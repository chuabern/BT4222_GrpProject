Our aim is to provide a safe environment where students and families can learn about growing, waste management and healthy eating. This will help create a happy healthy life. 
Our garden will be used for class and school growing. Provide lessons on growing, composting and soil management. We will provide plots for families to work in and hopefully run workshops for school and community. "
2,2,"Hello world :-] My name is Bryan. I have been tinkering with metal and stone for about 10 years. I started out wrapping stones in twisted wires for people that I liked. people would occasionally offer to buy my work, but I've never been much of a salesman. over the years I have learned to solder, set stones, craft rivets, and all manner of other techniques. I have invested in what tools I have been able to along the way, but as my skills have broadened, so has my need for the larger, and more expensive tool-sets (Centrifugal casting machine, wet grinder, drill press, bench roller...) well, the list is honestly endless. And the cost of nice stones, and metal media is rather astronomical! What I am asking for is a boost to fund my art. I give half my pieces away to people who are nice, or as gifts. and the other half I either sell cheap, or sit around like hidden treasures :-] I'm not out to necessarily get rich, so much as to enrich the world with off the wall awesome metal things :-] "

Regardless of the success of this Kickstarter campaign, SHRIEKS AND SHIVERS FROM THE HORROR ZINE will be released in trade paperback and eBook format on January 6, 2015. 
So, then why are we asking for money? We want to move this project beyond the ""normal"" small press anthology. The majority of funds from this campaign will be funneled back to the emerging authors included in the project. What's an emerging author? They're the authors you may not have heard of yet, but we suspect you will hear of them in the not so distant future. 
The goal here is small, only $2500, much smaller than most anthologies on Kickstarter. The reason behind this is to set obtainable stretch goals. For every $500 over the $2,500 goal, the emerging authors will each receive an additional payment for their stories. This means the sky's the limit!

How will the money be spent? 
This pie chart is based on an estimate of rewards, but it shows how the majority of the funds raised will go back to the authors. 
Special to this campaign is a LIMITED EDITION hardback version of SHRIEKS AND SHIVERS FROM THE HORROR ZINE.  Yes, you read that right, a HARDBACK! "

7,7,"When it comes to buying course material, students have two essential problems: 
Complexity and Price.  
The world has long understood the price problem, but the complexity problem is less understood, and it directly affects the price problem.  You see, if students don't know all their options, or don't understand what they actually need (or don't need), they're going to pay too much.
PageLess solves the complexity problem, which solves the price problem.
When a student uses PageLess to search for course material, PageLess doesn't focus on the item they searched. It focuses on the CONTENT they need.  This may sound like a minor difference, but there's nothing minor about the savings it creates.
 PageLess isn't a textbook comparison site.  
Yeah, we compare prices as well as anyone, but it's the most boring thing we do. PageLess is a textbook search engine that guides students through the buying process so they only buy what they need.  Other search engines return results for a single item.  PageLess returns results for EVERY item with the same content.
And PageLess doesn't sell anything.  After we work our fancy textbook magic and give students all their options, PageLess sends them to the websites they already know and trust to complete their purchases.  Incidentally, PageLess makes a small commission when students use our links, which will allow us to make PageLess sustainable. 
Our website is programmed in Angular, a state-of-the-art programming language that creates a wildly pleasing user experience. Our design and branding is as futuristic as the service we offer.  We have a world class software developer on staff and are contracting with other professionals to help us program, design, and market PageLess once it's completed.
""Ok, great.  But how does it work?""
So glad you asked.
We tried to make PageLess intuitive and self-explanatory when using it, but since you are reading a Kickstarter and not using our site, let's break it down.
In the screenshot below, the student searched for a looseleaf book (a book with no binding.)  They probably thought the looseleaf was going to be cheaper.  It isn't. PageLess connected the looseleaf ISBN they searched to every format available. It's going to save this student a lot of money.  It’s also going to get them a nicer book for class.
The higher quality bound version of the book is about half price. Rent it instantly in the digital format if you need it fast.
Other comparison sites would have only compared the price of the looseleaf book and maybe the eBook.  With PageLess, we compare 6 options, and some are much cheaper. 
But here's PageLess' most powerful capability.
In the example below,  PageLess does what no other textbook search engine can fully do. It identifies the FORMAT of every searched item and links it together with every other format that has the same content!  In our example, PageLess instantly knows that the item searched is a textbook package, specifically an access code package that consists of two items: a printed book and a one-time use printed access code.  
PageLess knows that the item searched comes with an access code.
Let's say the student clicks ""yes"" because they need the access code.  They will then see this:
PageLess knows what content is contained in every search.
And here's the results page.  Note: the student has the option to add a print book if they wish, or to just buy the package they originally searched, but we don't suggest doing that, as it's going to cost him or her a lot more money.  Before PageLess, this student had a single option--to purchase the full package for over $100.
PageLess knows the access code already comes with an eBook, so save money and just buy the code.
But what if you don't need that access code? It's fairly common to not need it. Choose ""No, I don't need the code"" and you will see this:
Don't need the code, then don't buy on the package page!
PageLess directs those students who don't need the code to just buy the book (which is a different format), and then offers them that book's CONTENT in every format available. Check it out:
If you don't need the code, just buy the book, but NOT on the package page.
PageLess does so much more than these two examples.  I could go on...but you may have noticed that we're already going a bit long here.
So, why do we need your money?
Students need your help, especially during this pandemic, to find the content they need at the lowest price possible, and they have to be able to do it remotely.
We'll use the money we raise to complete the technical work on our site, which is mainly research and development, working out bugs, testing, and data entry. PageLess' complexity is mind-boggling, and our developers informed us that they only work if we pay them.  
 If we exceed our goal, we'll use the money to save students even more.
Every cent earned over $4500.00 will go toward helping students save money.  We have lots of ideas for new functionality and for integrating formats that publishers are just creating.
Check out our rewards.  
A  Zoom session or presentation will make you a PageLess expert.  Once you're an expert you can spread the word and teach your friends or colleagues.  You'll pretty much be a hero.
Oh, and consider grabbing one of our environmentally friendly and beautifully branded aluminum or stainless steel water bottles.

Students need PageLess NOW.
PageLess was always going to help students, but there has never been a better time for it to launch than now.  Because of the pandemic, millions of students find themselves going to school online for the first time.  They have no bookstores.  They have no on-campus help to find their course material.  With your help, PageLess can stand in the gap and help students source the CONTENT they need for less. 
Make a pledge.  Share this campaign with anyone you know who is a student or who has students in their lives.  Post it on social media.  Together we can help make college affordable for all."
8,8,"As an answer to the spontaneous and complex web of global maritime regulations related to environmental compliance, the idea for a centralized source of information, formatted and ready for use was born. Below is a consolidated version of the whitepaper research on the original concept which will be finalized in this project as we expand the scope to the general public.  
The     Maritime Environmental Hub
Forming a unified     central database for marine environmental shipping regulations and the     associated framework linking those with a role in creating, managing or     providing information. Regulation Facilitation.
7/22/2018
Overview
The goal has been defined as a centralized database of marine environmental relating to the massive maritime industry comprising of over 90,000 vessels worldwide. (1) An industry spread globally along several sectors all of which have an impact in their own respective ways. Ranging from governance on an international level of nearly 200 countries, to regional maritime authorities, to flag states, down to the local port limits, the industry is regulated on how it may impact the environment with solid enforcement across the board.  In addition to the policies set out aimed directly at the shipping industry, regional environmental agencies not only have the power to but are dedicated to protecting the marine environment by creating protected areas with their own specific limits of use. To this day the details of these policies and how they impact the shipping industry remains with the policy makers and the facilitation of this information must take several paths to reach the proper destination. The time and effort needed to obtain this information can be daunting, and in many cases it goes missing. The solution is access to a one stop shop for marine environmental shipping regulations. Creating the means to obtain this information, centralize it and easily facilitate it to those who need it most. The goal is to reduce unlawful operations, accidental discharges and protect the marine environment.
Background
Ship Operation
In the shipping industry, on a daily basis ships of all types and sizes transit many different areas of the oceans and the seas. These ships depend upon discharging and eliminating all types of waste from their vessel in order to operate at a safe and sanitary level. Although this discharging is essential for normal ship process, these are pollutants that have an effect on the environment. It is the job of several types of government bodies to regulate these pollutants from vessel to minimize the impact. Almost all ships must abide by these regulations which are and will be in the coming years constantly progressing. Each shipping company has set up company regulations in which their ships must follow in order to avoid heavy fines and penalties from violating the laws and regulations set forth.
It is the duty and the combined effort for several officers onboard each ship to maintain a level of conciseness towards these sometimes strict regulations. It is necessary for shipboard safety to follow these discharge regulations in a very essential manner. It is also essential for the company itself to ensure its vessels remain in compliance as many violations create large to very large fines for the company. With this being said, since the research for these regulations is mostly done manually, there is considerable room for error as well as the possibility of missing critical information. Both can have severe consequences for the vessel and company. In order for a vessel to ensure they are in compliance they must rely on many factors. These include information from company management, communications with local agents, and research within given publications and reference materials. Normally local agencies were depended upon and fully relied upon by shipping companies as having the most accurate and detailed information. As the industry has progressed and regulations advance, companies are more and more reluctant to rely on local agents. This is mostly in part due to instances resulting from a lack of diligence by the local agents, especially in non developed regions. If regulations are compiled onboard a vessel it is down to the ship’s crew to maintain and manage how to store this information. The task of staying compliant is becoming more and more complex given the ever changing regulations, the various crew members rotating onboard, and the expansion of itineraries. Once all regulations are set, there also becomes the need to ensure the vessel follows all regulations on operations down to the minute and mile. Daily meetings are usually in place to discuss such requirements and operations, yet human error can still remain an issue.
Policy Creation and Implementation
In order to have the greatest effect on minimizing environmental impact, policies regarding restrictions for the maritime industry start on an international level and continue down as local as specific port limit regulations. On the top of international policy sits the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and subsequently the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC), the committee of the IMO responsible for the creation of international standards for the prevention of pollution from ships. These regulations form MARPOL 73/78; The international Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. There are 159 signatories of MARPOL which have representation on the MEPC who meet annually to develop and agree upon these standards. (2) It is the responsibility of the Flag states to ensure their specific requirements cover everything implemented under MARPOL. The policies stated in MARPOL are generally recognized and enforced worldwide as it is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution from ships. These regulations come with the highest consequences of non-compliance, though most are well known and clearly outlined within six MARPOL annexes, each dedicated to a particular type of pollution.
Annex
Description
Annex I
Regulations for the   Prevention of Pollution by Oil
Annex II
Regulations for the control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances   (NLS)
Annex III
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by harmful substances in   packaged form
Annex IV
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by Sewage from ships
Annex V
Regulations for the prevention of Pollution by Garbage from ships
Annex VI
Regulations for the prevention of Air Pollution from ships
During each annual MEPC meeting many changes are discussed and many new regulations are set to come into force within the following year. The regulations set out in MARPOL are generally the most generic and developed with the entire industry in mind. This prevents the IMO from designating many specific areas for protection and leaves this for local and regional agencies.
Regional agencies cover large areas or state areas for development and enforcement of environmental regulations. These are usually government bodies specific to either a country or a group of countries under a union such as the European Union. Examples of these agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from the USA, European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), and the China Maritime Safety Administration (CMSA). Consequently a particular territory may have additional authorities setting out their own set of rules and regulations such as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the USA. In addition to these organizations dedicated to environment and maritime areas, most nations or regions have health sectors of government which regulate certain aspects of vessel operations as well. For instance in the United States, there is the United States Public Health (USPH), and in Brazil, ANVISA. Both of which restrict certain discharges into the seas under their authority. Using the United States as an example of how multiple agencies work by taking into account the EPA, NOAA and the USPH. The EPA develops discharge restrictions and criteria under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for all vessels within United States waters extending to 3 nautical miles from shore, including wastewater. The USPH requires vessels to change the water in recreational water facilities (RWF) such as swimming pools, but does not allow their discharge within 12 nautical miles from land. Furthermore NOAA designates and manages marine protected areas (MPA) such as National Marine Sanctuaries which contain their own set of environmental regulations. Luckily in the United States the National Marine Protected Areas Center, the governing body which designates MPAs, is a sector of a larger administration which also manages maritime shipping activity (NOAA) and works closely with the US Maritime Administration (MARAD). Unfortunately this is not standard around the world and many protected areas are put into force without detailed consideration on the affects to the maritime or shipping industry. This leaves some room for interpretation. This interpretation usually ends up lying with the management of shipping companies and flag state administrations.
Each and every vessel must be registered to a particular flag state, however not all vessels are flagged under the same country as the vessel owners. The main purpose of a flag state administration is to ensure that all vessels flying their flag are in compliance with international conventions and standards. This includes safety, certification and pollution prevention. The flag state also enforces additional policies for its vessels to comply with the laws of the flag state as well. A United States flagged vessel will need to comply with international regulations as well as U.S. shipping regulations regardless the vessel’s location at any time. Flag states are responsible to the IMO and have their own set of regulations regarding the monitoring and inspection of international standards. Many flag states issue notices and circulars to the shipping companies flying their flag in an attempt to maintain compliance throughout their fleets. Although the main goal of a flag state is to maintain compliance on an international level, when violations on a local level are possible, the flag state is expected to react. It becomes a perpetual burden for organizations such as flag states and shipping companies to keep its vessels up to date with anything more than the most general international regulation.
The lower end tiers such as sub-regional (US State), and port specific regulations cover the smallest area although usually come with the tightest restrictions. Each particular Port Authority may impose their own environmental regulation in response to additional protection needed on a local level. State regulations in the US may also include specific restrictions within state waters and are governed by the state itself.  None of these would undermine international, regional or state regulations, rather add another layer to the accumulation.
Although nearly 97% of the world’s oceans are free from protection, there are almost 15,000 marine protected areas throughout the globe. (3) These protected areas come in various shapes, sizes and levels of protection. The main goal of conservation is clear, but unfortunately some of these areas do not have specific clear guidelines on how they affect the operation of passing ships. Likewise if they do have guidelines, they are not well known and usually don’t come into play until a violation has occurred. This again leaves a heavy burden on shipping companies and vessel officers in determining how to manage their operations. Additionally most MPAs are not designated on nautical charts to notify mariners of their location. This leads to common errors of compliance and unfortunately goes mostly unnoticed. Regardless of the designating authority all protected areas are compiled on an international level under UNEP in the WDPA. With so much of the open ocean which falls under no particular jurisdiction (60%), the UN are taking steps towards protecting this region under a high-seas biodiversity treaty. This treaty will delegate the steps for designation, monitoring, and enforcement of marine protected areas on the high seas. Facilitation of this information is key, especially to those crossing oceans, operating commercial vessels, and calling the sea home.
Under the tiers of the regulatory pyramid fall shipping company specific policy. Company policy normally goes above and beyond regulations set out by international, flag state and regional standards. This ensures smooth operations of vessels covering most ports and areas around the world. Although this may seem a particularly simple task, there is a need for intense and constant collaboration due to two major factors. The first is the ever changing industry and the consistency of regulations requires constant collaboration. The second factor is related to the effect these regulations have on shipboard operations. In general limiting shipboard operations can be critical to the safety, efficiency, timing and overall success of a vessels voyage. Determining a clear and distinct line between protecting the environment and limiting shipboard operations is of the upmost importance for any shipping company. In short, by doing too little a company faces fines, a bad reputation and a degree of certainty that will not allow them to compete in the future as regulations advance. By doing too much, the company faces expensive overhead costs, increased time constraints, overall risk to voyage efficiency, and the need of additional resources for management. Regardless of the company policy, the shipping companies themselves are also the first level of enforcement for any regulation no matter the designation level.
Policy Enforcement
Generally the enforcement aspect falls into different hands than those who develop environmental regulations. This remains constant down to sub-regional/port levels where as mentioned previously, the lowest tiers of sub-regional agencies and local port authorities have sufficient means of inspection and enforcement. Likewise public health agencies mostly carry out their own inspections as well. At the regional and international level, most policies are enforced through coast guard agencies or similar means such as port state control (PSC). Port state control inspections are carried out under the Paris MOU, an international agreement providing the means for foreign vessels to be inspected by PSC officials. PSC officials maintain the right to inspect vessels under certain criteria although it’s important to note that the responsibility of maintaining safe and compliant operation lies with ship owners and flag states. (4) In order to ensure that ship owners are maintaining a level of compliance across the board, regular company audits are carried out.  As mentioned previously, the objective of the flag state is to ensure a vessel’s compliance with international standards. This can be done through the use of a classification society which in turn carries out the vessel inspections. A classification society is a non-governmental organization which is authorized to carry out vessel inspections in order to prove compliance ranging from flag state regulations to insurance policy requirements. Each and every vessel falls under a classification society or class, which certifies the equipment onboard, the vessels construction, and the vessels operations among others.
Abstract
The Environmental Compliance Assistance Platform or ECAP for short is a software system installed on a vessel’s navigation bridge to help plan and monitor the vessel’s environmental operations. The ECAP uses electronic navigation charts and calculates the vessels position in relation to regulated areas. The operational aspect of the ECAP system alone is useful for ship’s crew although at its core is the requirement to provide various levels of environmental regulations and their respective boundaries. Distance calculations and alarm functions alone assist in the normal operation of the vessel, although without the core database the ECAP unit is operating at limited capacity. The ECAP unit is the means of passing the vital regulatory information directly into the bitter end users. In order to complete this objective, the database must be built. The data will come from several sources among various levels of management and designation. This will ensure the most comprehensive environmental compliance tool possible. Regulatory bodies create the rules, the operators must follow the rules, and everything in-between needs a smooth channel for efficient use. The concept of how to get the information from the database to the end users and effectively use it is solved with the ECAP. The concept of how to obtain the information from those who create it into the database is the concept of the Maritime Environmental Hub (MEH).  The MEH is the platform for which policy makers and regulatory bodies can provide the details of the regulations under their responsibility. The MEH is designed for ease of use for not only end users but for the individuals which will be updating and adding information. The Maritime Environmental Hub project is characterized by a unique environmental governance system for capacity building and knowledge sharing. It acts as a bridge between national, regional and local governments and facilitates interaction between key international organizations, port planners and developers, policy makers, the private sector and citizens. Local and regional governments will earn recognition for their achievements while also contributing to and benefiting from the exchange and dissemination of best practices for environmental protection and sustainable development at local and regional level.

Benefits
The maritime industry is filled with a maze of regulations all of which must be adhered to not only to realistically conserve the marine environment but also promote a positive reputation and avoid costly violations. Looking even further past the benefits for the end users and the companies utilizing the information, policy makers and regulators have the opportunity to explore how they relate to the industry. Each user no matter the level of access will have the ability to compare different regions. This will ideally lead to the spread of useful and effective ideas across the board. No one region is exactly the same as another, though similar measures can be taken to promote the conservation of the marine environment and regulate those operations or activities which may have highest impact. Access to the information is a concept and the spreading of ideas is inevitable when this is achieved.
Image and publicity is high priority and must include environmental friendly operations. It is obvious to say any publicity outlining a negative environmental impact from a shipping company can be disastrous. Furthermore the statistic shows that 60-80 % of cruise passengers are ready to pay more if they are sure that the cruise company is environmental friendly. Even cargo companies are forced to present promotion of environment conservation due to the ever growing ability of consumers to track their goods.
Violations throughout the world can be severely costly to shipping companies and have undesirable effects on not only crew but company managers and employees. Under the US Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), a vessel which is found to violate the regulations set forth are subject to fines upwards of $1,000,000. Additionally within the United States unauthorized pollution by a ship in marine protected areas can have fines of $100,000 per violation, per day. (5)

The Future
The concept of the Maritime Environmental Hub is not a fixed or set with a permanent finish line. As the industry grows with time, the regulations that control the operations within will always advance with it. This creates the opportunity to leave an open-ended condition for the MEH not only allowing the updating and supplementing of information but making these an essential part of the success moving forward. All in all, an updated MEH will produce the most comprehensive environmental compliance database for the industry. The MEH will serve as a template for what can be done and hopefully lead to additional hubs dealing with other complex streams of the undeniably fundamental information the industry relies on.

9,9,"My passion consists of being a mother to my two beautiful children and creating. Lately, I have been noticing that my art stuff has completely taken over my entire house! I have no space for anything else! This gave me the idea to try to build an art studio so that I can continue to create more works of art that everyone can love and appreciate. Without my own space, I will have a hard time creating beautiful works of art. Especially some of my bigger pieces, I need a lot of room to work on those, and my living room just isn't cutting it!

I also love creating custom portraits!

10,10,"Theatre Forever's The Nature Crown is a wild and imaginative new piece of theater conceived and directed by Jon Ferguson - created with the ensemble with text by Dominic Orlando. The Nature Crown will make its world premier in the Guthrie Theater's Dowling Studio, running March 21 through April 5, 2015.
The Nature Crown is told through the eyes of a stranger who, at a crossroads in his life, finds himself jolted from his reality and lost in the woods. With only a broken briefcase and a sad potted plant, he finds - at the center of it all - a village within his own heart. 
Highly physical, comic and poetic, The Nature Crown will bring Theatre Forever's special brand of playful, irreverent and imaginative new work to the Guthrie Theater. It features some of the Twin Cities most exciting actors, musicians and theater-makers. 
By contributing to this campaign you will be supporting the artists / theatre-makers dedicating their time and artistry to the creation of this deeply moving and thought provoking performance piece – a new work that explores origin, innocence, community and change. 
The Nature Crown is set in a village. The creation of a village demands a large cast and creative team of performers, musicians and designers; 26 in total. All donations raised through this campaign will go directly toward paying these collaborators for their time, their commitment and their artistry. Your generosity means the world to us. 
THANK YOU!
Love Forever, 
Theatre Forever

All you need is to be connected to the internet and about 14 cents a day to subscribe to the service.  For registered users in poor and war-ravaged countries, Accompany will be available for free.   ""Music accompanies peace"" is my motto.  (See the article below that came out about Accompany in Yahoo Finance). http://finance.yahoo.com/news/music-accompanies-peace-violinist-creates-150000122.html?soc_src=mediacontentstory&soc_trk=fb
ACCOMPANY - why?
I'm a music teacher and a classical violinist and pianist by training. I've always felt there was a need in the market for a niche app which classical musicians could use as a practice tool to play along with during sessions.  From the onset, the idea behind my app's content was that it wouldn't be metronomic or robotic ""karaoke"" versions of the music. Nor would my music be limited to just one tempo like accompaniment recordings. And unlike other apps which require training and are expensive since they charge per piece, mine would be instantly intuitive, it would be inexpensive and it would feature beautiful and professionally recorded accompaniment for the whole repertoire. Everything - sonatas, concertos, short pieces, etudes, drones, scales, and different instruments would be available in one place, for just a few pennies a day - basically enough to keep the product up and running.
ACCOMPANY features a nice and easy-to-use design, heavily inspired by the work of industrial designer Dieter Rams, who worked for Braun and who heavily influenced Apple's designs. 
Accompany coding is bullet-proof. The sound quality is amazing. The app is super easy to use. And I've purposefully kept the subscription cost really low so that a music student in any country or economy can easily afford to use my product. (Subscription cost breaks down to literally pennies a day). Need to practice that Beethoven Sonata at 3am right before your jury or recital? No problem.  Want to learn how to hear better so you play better in tune?  Got it.  Wanna practice violin, cello, flute, voice, etc., music all at the same cost?  On it.  Coming very soon.
So far I've scraped together my life savings, sold my possessions on eBay, and saved all the money I possibly could.  My income as a local music teacher is limited.  My family thinks I'm crazy. Yet, I have a passionate belief that I am creating a worthwhile app for music students, and it's only going to get better with time.  
I’ve received many positive comments and encouragement from noted violinists and teachers like virtuoso James Ehnes and professor Kurt Sassmannshaus. Other well known online pedagogues like Beth Blackerby (violinlab.com) and Lora Staples (www.reddesertviolin.com) have also been heartwarmingly generous in their enthusiastic support.  
Let's work together to make this a success story. I've already been offered an article in a major industry magazine and I've got contacts on Facebook and throughout the classical music world.
Here's specifically what more money is needed for, either from my own income, or from the generous support of my supporters:
1. Hiring advanced students and professionals to record more repertoire not just for violin but for different instruments and voice.  I have an old MacBook pro I use - it would eventually be nice to upgrade the memory and processor.
2. Paying for things like continued programming and site development and maintenance (expensive).  I don't do programming - I have to hire professionals who know what they're doing or the result would be disastrous.
3. Advertising and marketing (very expensive).  You can have a cool app but if nobody knows you exist...exactly.
4. Instant noodles are not free and often needed past midnight.
So, every bit helps.  10 bucks helps.  50 bucks helps more!
Thanks for your interest and support.

13,13,"Hi! I'm Victoria and I am currently a senior at UNO studying fine arts. I've always loved drawing and making things so when I realized I could do that for a living I jumped at the chance. The only thing better than making art is sharing it with others! But of course to do that it will cost money, thus this Kickstarter. After much consideration I decided the perfect place to start would be with Humphrey. From the moment I started him until the moment I finished I genuinely loved drawing him. With encouraging words from my friends I knew that I had to make Humphrey available to anyone who would want him!
The Humphrey pin will be 1.25 inches tall and will include Humphrey along with his gradient background. All proceeds from the pin will go right back into the business so I can make even more wonderful pins in the future and hopefully expand out more to projects such as prints and even stickers!
This is honestly a dream come true for me, to be able to make art that I love and then share it with the world. Any money you can spare is so very appreciated and I can't do anything without the support from others.
Thank you so much and I hope you love my work as much as I do!

15,15,"What this Kickstarter Offers!
One Blog theme, written in enterprise level Angular.  An Angular version fo the Food Advisor application, under the general Strapi Github space. [Food Advisor Github can be seen here and current live Food Advisor application can be seen here.] Lastly, we will enhance documentation for the Food Advisor repo + take ownership for the front end open source side of Strapi
Why Did This Kickstarter Happen?!
Many people love Strapi as a CMS, as it is an open source headless CMS, that you get to self host. Server integration with Strapi is really well documented too. However, those coming from a Wordpress, or similar background, which is all of us, are missing out on the theming abilities. That is, being able to buy a theme, and plug and play into Strapi. That is where the inspiration for this Kickstarter came from, and why it is happening. 
What Happens When Kickstarter Officially Get's Funded?
30 days after the Kickstarter is officially funded, we will have ready to deliver an Enterprise Level, Open Source, Blog Theme for Strapi (It will be written in Angular). Complete documentation can be expected for the theme. All the way from changing icons, to how to run unit, and end to end tests. 
45 days after the Kickstarter is complete, we will have created the equivalent Food Advisor Angular equivalent, as well as improve documentation for the Strapi Food Advisor Github repo. Razroo will also create 50 different business use cases for which Strapi might be ideal, and the ideal front end framework to use with Strapi, in those 50 different use cases(storefront, blog, project management, dynamic business CMS etc.).
60 days after we will begin taking ownership of the open source front end side for Strapi. This means we will be putting out a poll on Twitter for the next framework to be built out to. This means building out already built Blog Theme from Angular, and moving to React, Vue, Svelte etc. next. The highest voted framework wins.
90 days after we will deliver the same blog theme, in the next framework(,or lack thereof). It will be open sourced, ready to go. 
At this point, we are well on our way for creating a Blog Theme for all frameworks. Razroo will continue to take ownership of open source, and continue building out the Blog Theme to different frameworks. 
Any contributions are more than appreciated, and we are definitely looking forward to creating themes that will make your life easier, and decrease the amount of time it takes you to develop your next project. Thank you.
Note: This money will be going to Razroo, and not to Strapi, to build this open source application for the benefit of Strapi, and the general Strapi Ecosystem. We are working closely with Strapi team, to make sure this benefits the community as much as possible, in as intuitive as a fashion as possible. "

17,17,"We are three IT professionals, who would like to give back to creative community in small non-profit organizations by buying selective products from them, doing value addition and sell through our website, Giftganga.com. Specifically, we would like to reach out to smaller organizations who do not have means or expertise to market.
These are unique giftable items that you may not have received or given yet! A three-fold gift:
a gift of giving - for yourself when you buy the product,
a gift of inspiration - to the person receiving the gift, and,
a gift of self-reliance - to remote underprivileged artisans
Gifts Ganga...
Once we identify the product, and decide on the value additions, we do the required work in Virginia, US. We see the value in continuing such creative effort and building such a portal. Funding is needed for buying such products, design and fabricate the value addition and bring them to larger market.
Artisans
Silk thread embroidered cards and banana bark artworks are made by residents of Anandwan. Anandwan is a community rehabilitation center for leprosy patients and the disabled, founded by social activist Late Baba Amte in India. These artisans gain a sense of dignity and self-reliance through the sales of these items.
Custom Frame Of a Unique Design
Above banana bark artwork is made by them as well.. however it is not offered as part of this project at this time.  In fact, following 16"" x 20"" frame is one of the rewards in this project.
Bird and Flowers in a Shadowbox Frame
 A Story
All in a days work :-)
In 2014, I met Shakuntala at Anandwan, India; as I watched her embroider greeting cards using her toes, I was struck by her vigor and dignity in spite of her huge handicap with cerebral palsy.  I bought all greeting cards that she had available then and decided to donate to her organization.  Back home, I began thinking that the greeting card format may not be giving justice to her art.  If I framed the artwork, it would be a constant inspiration on my kitchen wall, instead of being hidden in a pile of stuff in a drawer!  I framed some of those greeting cards and yes, it worked!  I then ordered more cards and raised funds for the organization.  
When I was relating this experience to a coworker, she got so motivated, that she bought 16 frames to give to her family and friends for Christmas - she said that was the best gift she could ever give to herself!!
Why Support The project
We are motivated to work on this project because it gives us opportunity to help uplift the underprivileged artisans, giving them true self-reliance.
Variety of unique designs
It also gives us the opportunity to connect the worlds of Haves and Have Nots - leveraging our own creativity. With your help, we intend to reach out many more remote organizations across the world to bring their gifts to you!

18,18,"Skateboarding drives me Crazy! But in a good way, of course. It is the most challenging activity I have ever put my mind to. The time, energy, and thought process used to learn even the simplest trick makes school and work seem like a joke. This is what makes skateboarding so addictive....not to mention it is the most fun one could possibly have. You learn how to do things that you honestly felt to be previously impossible.
For kids, I believe this activity can play a huge role in the development of a variety of positive traits. I know that skateboarding from childhood has made me a more dedicated, loyal, patient, quick thinking, understanding, and hardworking person. To be a progressive skateboarder, you have to have these attributes, anything less and you would give up on skateboarding completely.
This brings me to why I am looking to open The Garage, indoor skateboarding facility in Everett, WA.
The younger generation in this area are more excited about skateboarding then ever before. On any given day you can find the local skateparks packed to the brim with young minds hard at work on their skateboards. The only problem is, these parks are all outdoors and located in one of the wettest states in the US. That means, when it rains there is nowhere for kids to skate, while staying dry. But this can change with your help!
My wife and I are seeking $15,000 to pay for wood, screws, paint, steel, sheet metal, and labor to construct a one of a kind indoor skateboarding facility. This park will be designed and hand crafted by my friends and myself, aka Vic's Market, with the help of an experienced skatepark builder. With all parties involved having skateboarded for roughly 20 years a piece, the final product will surely be a masterpiece.
Once opened, feel free to stop by any time and skate, even if it's your first time, and enjoy watching your money being put to a good use. The kids and parents in Everett will thank you for it. Thanks for checking out our page and remember... ""With Your Help We Will Open THE GARAGE!!"""
19,19,"So What are You doing?
My team and I are building MerKaBa, an interactive, magical prayer portal. We will install this portal at the 2013 Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. We have a grant from Burning Man to build the base structure. We are asking your support so we can purchase the equipment necessary to make our portal really hum. We want to make sure that when you encounter MerKaBa on the playa, we will have provided you with a sophisticated, interactive, psychospiritual instrument of transport.  We want to make sure you have a blast playing with our sound and light interactive toy.
The MerKaBa dome by day (computer rendering
The MerKaBa at night (computer rendering)
You're building a MerKaBa?  What in blazes is a MerKaba? 
The traditional mercaba is a mythological transport device that allows the devout worshiper a face to face audience with his or her local deity. 
The Mercaba of traditional mythology
Our MerKaBa device will be a psychedelic prayer portal for transporting thousands of Black Rock City citizens into a contemplative and celebratory interaction with their own powerful imaginations. And beyond, of course! 
As a work of art, our MerKaBa is an exploration into the nature of consensus reality and how we use it to interpret — and to shape — our experiences within predefined cultural norms. 
How exactly are you going to make this? 
We’re already started building a 9’ tall hexagonal dome out of 12 gauge steel. The steel will be plasma cut with a fractal pattern revealing a turning mirrored obelisk on the inside. The obelisk will be filled with the prayers and aspirations that you send to us and will turn 24/7 for the duration of the event until we remove your prayers to burn in the Temple Burn on Sunday night. 
Plasma cut steel panel - wicked cool!
The dome will be painted white to better reflect a hallucinatory dreamscape video montage that will be projected onto all six sides of the dome. Many of the avatars of your favorite deities, philosophic leaders or intellectual giants will make an appearance. You are free to worship, dance, sing or recite poetry as you bask in their darshan. 
Panel detail
How are you making it into an interactive instrument?
Our MerKaBa dome will be equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors. As you approach the dome these sensors detect your proximity and movement setting into motion an interactive array of sound and lighting effects.
Sound system schematic
We invite you to send us audio files of your prayers, yearnings, desires and demands so we can mash them into an array of different sound montages. Feel free to speak, chant, sing, scream, or whisper as feels appropriate. 
When you explore these ultrasonic and infrared triggers out on the open playa……. the musical prayers you induce from the MerKaBa dome might appeal to the local gods, attracting their divine attention. You might even stir the interest of the Giant Alien Cat Overlords rumored to be lurking nearby. 
GACOs just can't resist the MerKaBa!
Yikes! And then what happens? 
Depending upon your faith, anything might happen. 
Perhaps, rapturous angels of ecstasy will draw you into deep exotic, florid and orgasmic hallucinations of group orgiastic hierophany.
Perhaps you will discover the MerKaBa’s secret G-spot. 
Perhaps you will spend the entire week activating wave upon wave of sycophantic climax for one and all. 
Perhaps you will simply have a rollicking good time activating our visual and audio tricks. 
This project is gonna be awesome! So what do you need? 
We want to involve you, we want to entice you to contribute. We have a range of gifts to offer in return, things like MerKaBa stickers, pendants and t-shirts, as well as the opportunity to include your prayers and chants in the portal itself. For more generous donors we want to offer handmade ceramic art based on the MerKaBa theme. 
Yay Stickers!!!
Your donations will go towards the electronics, sound and light that have to be both cutting-edge, cool and bomb-proof to withstand the incredibly harsh conditions of the open playa. 
We’re thrilled to be working on this, and hope you are thrilled to be a part of it now and once we get to Burning Man!  "
20,20,"     Hello, my name is Alexis and I am working with my father to try and get a company off the ground with code that he has worked on for over 20 years. We are planning to make an application that will allow you to create your own art with auto optimization royalty free and be able to export said art to any other 3D modelling application. It started about 22 years ago with an idea of a better way to optimize the amount of triangles used. We have surpassed pen and paper and so close to being able to go live. We hope with some help that we can make this dream come true.            
     We are working full time on trying to get through these last few bugs and plan to have a releasable product in the next month. This means so much to us because we hope that by simplifying the process for anyone to be able to create their own art, people will be able to make games, models, and more. This application allows you to make your own 3D models that can be saved and printed out with a 3D printer. You can play with what feels like adult lego's, save and then sell what you make or use it in a new game with your own custom art!         
     We work from home so the house currently is an expense, we need more equipment, need to do a lot of advertising and time for work. So about $25,000 would be enough to push our exciting product out on the market!"

22,22,"“NAMES” 
We are final year BA (hons.) Mixed Media Fine Art students at the University of Westminster, working towards our Degree Show, “NAMES”at Ambika P3, Marylebone Road in June 2015. Ambika P3 is one of the largest exhibition spaces in central London at 14000 sq. ft. Our aim is to make the exhibition an ambitious and thought-provoking presentation of our art practices across various media, which have developed over three years of study and practical engagement. The exhibition will present the culmination of three years’ hard work and will feature 44 talented young graduating artists. Due to the mixed media nature of the course, the show will feature work across a variety of creative disciplines and mediums; Westminster students continually strive to push the boundaries of contemporary art practice and self-expression. 
About the Show
BA (Hons) Mixed Media Fine Art is a 3 year, full time degree course that culminates in a final exhibition featuring a body of work by each graduating artist. With the show fast approaching, planning, organisation and fundraising are now in full swing; the show is an exciting project for us and provides both closure and a chance to exhibit our work in a professional, ambitiously scaled environment.“Names” will bridge the gap between the study of fine-art practice and our future careers as artists. However, in order to successfully put on the show we are aspiring towards there are substantial financial demands. We need your generosity to help us reach our fundraising target. We are aiming to raise £1000 through Kickstarter to help make our Degree Show truly outstanding, so that we can show the world what we’re capable of. The money pledged will contribute towards: 
• The catalogue: we aim to produce a professional catalogue as a document of the artists’ development, so that visitors to the exhibition can take away a piece of their viewing experience – this will also mean further exposure for the artists in the show. 
 • The Private View card and further publicity: alongside the catalogue we aim to produce an invitation card which can be used to publicise the exhibition to art-lovers, gallerists, friends and family. We want as many people as possible to see the work we have strived to create. 
 • Refreshments for the private view evening: everyone likes a drink! 
It is worth noting that this exhibition project is thoroughly student-led and that we are involved in every aspect of the event planning. From the design of the catalogue to the curation of the exhibition and the marketing and publicity, everything is done by the students on the course. This helps to minimise the costs of the event by ‘cutting out the middle-man’ and ensuring that the money we raise is used sparingly and appropriately. Being involved in the process from start to finish is also valuable experience for our further professional lives as independent artists. 
The Mixed Media Fine Art Degree Show at Ambika P3: 
Public View - 2 June 2014 6:30pm - 8:30pm 
Exhibition open 1 - 4 June 11am – 6pm 
Ambika P3; University of Westminster 35 Marylebone Road, London NW1 5LS 
The Rewards 
Please note that all rewards will be mailed after the Degree Show.

23,23,"Tragedy: All Metal Tribute to the Bee Gees & Beyond continues the decimation with the Disco Balls to the Wall World Tour, making a new CD, Death to False Disco-Metal, and shooting a video for the international hit It's Raining Men!
Be a part of it all. This new album is going to be absolutely decimating, not to mention the tour and the video, which will also be incredible!
The band is putting together funds for all of these exciting things:  touring, studio time, mastering, artwork, manufacturing for the new album, shooting and editing the new video, plus any and all incidentals which accompany such decimating activities.  With our upcoming Disco Balls to the Wall World Tour, we will be reaching billions of new fans across the globe, so it is a journey well worth joining!
Our remaining expenses come out to about $5,000 -- divided evenly between the record (including mastering, artwork and printing, etc.); the video; and the tour. It is our sincere hope that we raise this money -- but in the event we raise MORE -- worry not. The more funds we raise,  the more we can put into the production of the tour performances, the CD and the video.  Every dollar pledged will be put into making these ventures as awesome as possible. Plus, every pledge comes with a prize. There are no limits to the downloads we can give. Or the CD's and shirts (realistically as the world has a finite amount of fabrics and plastic) we can mail. 
Still thinking about it?  Well, Imagine your life before Tragedy.  Lonely.  Low-self-esteem.  Unwanted hair.  Erections lasting less than four hours.  But since Tragedy has come along, you have managed to bring together the once polarized parts of your soul: the part that likes disco and the part that likes metal.  The ""new you"" is fuller, firmer and longer than you have ever been.  Friends now describe you as ""shapely,"" ""tastefully perfumed,"" and ""supple.""  And you are a joy to be around.
No really, take a moment . . . just do it for a sec.  Imagine your life if Tragedy ceased to exist.  Flaccid.  Dry and Irritable.  Like a nasty rash.  And downright unpopular (that could refer to you as a person, or just your rash).  A pretty ugly picture, huh?  We would hate to see that happen to you, fan.
In the past, we have asked you to put a variety of things where your mouth is.  So now, we request, again, for your own well-being, dear fan, to please put your money where your mouth is, and then give us the money that is in your mouth.
You're welcome,

Please check out the latest updates for Blaze by visiting the updates section of this Kickstarter page. Also, please visit getblaze.co.uk for additional information
Blaze is a stackable miniature development board, based around a high-resolution 1.6"" display with capacitive touch and a high-speed 32-bit ARM micro-controller.
Blaze contains an on-board Micro SD socket for storage as well as a USB socket and various analog and digital external IO to allow expansion.
Blaze is also Arduino-compatible and can be used as a interface for your Arduino projects.
Blaze is pretty powerful for its size, here's what you can expect:
Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4
Model: MK22FN1M0VLH12
Clock Speed: 120MHz
Flash Memory: 1MB (upgraded from 512KB)
SRAM: 128KB
Display: 1.6"" TFT
Resolution: 240x240px
Color Depth: 262,143 colors
Touch: Capacitive
System Voltage: 3.3VDC
ADC Resolution: 16-bit
ADC Channels: 2x differential or 4x single ended
DAC Resolution: 12-bit
DAC Channels: 1x 
Dimensions:
Power:
Blaze can be powered from the on-board USB socket. Alternatively, it can derive its power from the VBAT pin on the external IO header which allows Blaze to be connected to external Li-Po batteries.
The ability to be powered from Li-Po batteries makes Blaze suitable for wearable applications.
Real-Time Clock :
Blaze has an on-board real-time clock, allowing you to keep track of time. By default, the RTC is disabled and is powered via dedicated VBAT pin on one of the external IO headers. Alternatively, a jumper can be fitted to Blaze which will ensure that the RTC is powered from the on-board 3.3V regulator, however, the RTC will lose track of time when Blaze is un-powered.
PWM:
Blaze can be configured to support up to 5x 16-bit PWM outputs. These PWM pins can also be used as input capture and output compare signals.
Graphical Prowess:
The following video gives you an idea of the drawing speed of Blaze, with fast, efficient routines making in excess of 300fps possible. In fact, the drawing of the random squares in the video was clocked at 340fps!

The following video shows how a simple 3D cube can be rendered on the display. A primitive 3D engine is being developed as part of the Blaze API.

Blaze also provides a number of external IO and power connections. The external IO allows you to connect Blaze to your own hardware or other such platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
Note - Blaze is a 3.3V system which means that it is only compatible with other 3.3V platforms such as Arduino Zero.
Almost all of the DIO signals can be configured to perform alternative functions, such as UARTS, I2C ports, ADC inputs, etc. This allows a great deal of flexibility and connectivity when interfacing to external sensors and other hardware.
The table below shows the alternative configurations possible for each pin:
All Blaze boards come shipped with the Blaze Bootloader. This allows you to download your own code to board over USB via the Blaze IDE - a development environment similar to the Arduino IDE.
Blaze IDE makes full use of the Blaze API - a complete software library written in C++ which provides extensive access to the on-board peripherals and provides optimized routines to allow drawing on the display. 
The present API has the following features:
- Powerful, efficient drawing routines including outline and fill
- Access to all external and internal peripherals of the ARM micro
- File access through the on-board SD card socket
- Multi-language support
- Image support (formats including Bitmaps and JPEGs)
- Support for any font
The following features are planned for Blaze and will be implemented during the campaign:
- Back-buffer support
- Alpha transparency
- 3D graphical routines (drawCube, drawSphere, etc)
- Transformation routines including translation, scaling and rotation
- Animation and keyframe support
Once the Kickstarter campaign finishes, the source code for Blaze will be available on GitHub - both Blaze API and Blaze IDE projects will be downloadable.
Enhanced Programmability:
Should you wish to go one step further, the JTAG signals are available on Blaze via the external GPIO so you can load in your own baremetal code. A BSP library will be made available which will allow you to get up and running with your own baremetal code.
RTOS Support:
Blaze can also support real-time operating systems such as mbed, Freescale MQX, FreeRTOS, etc however at this present time, the required board-support packages are not available.
Software Compatibility:
For those of you already familiar with coding for Arduino, Blaze API supports a compatibility layer to ease the transition between platforms.

Using only a few lines of code, you can quickly put together powerful, beautiful displays for your applications.
Hardware Compatibility:
Due to the non-Atmel nature of the microcontroller, Blaze is only hardware compatible with the Arduino platform via the external IO - and only Arduino boards which are 3.3V compatible such as the Arduino Zero.
Here are a number of suggestions for what you could do with your Blaze:
Smart-Watch:
A elegant and beautiful smart-watch display. Why not?
Mini Calculator:A miniature calculator that you can fit in the palm of your hand!
Twitter Display:
A palm-sized display for your tweets and notifications.
Mini Map Viewer:
Display mini-maps on your Blaze. Go one step further and create a micro navigation system
Simple App Launcher:
Launch your favourite apps via a simple interface across the USB link.
It would be awesome if you could help make Blaze a success. To make Blaze extra-cool, the following stretch goals are available should this campaign be successful:
£8,000 - Blaze IoT
An add-on board which turns Blaze into an IoT widget. Featuring BLE and Wi-Fi, Blaze can be connected to a multitude of devices and even The Cloud!

All additional functionality will be supported via the Blaze API (as well as in the Arduino compatibility API) and through the Blaze IDE.
£9,000 - Blaze IoT-X
As of the latest update, should the campaign get to £9,000 then an eXtended version of the IoT board will be available. The IoT-X board includes all current features of the IoT board but with additional GPS capabilities.
Note: unlike the IoT stretch goal, sadly this one isn't a freebie and would require an additional £20 to be added to your pledge in order to get this eXtended version.
See Update #12 for more information.
£12,000 - Blaze Box
A miniature enclosure for your Blaze!
Note: please be aware that the stretch goals will not affect the manufacturing schedule for Blaze or the overall quality of the end product. Blaze is the priority for this campaign and this will not be sacrificed. 
There are two fully-working Blaze prototypes in existence. A couple of minor tweaks need to be done to the hardware prior to manufacturing the boards. 
These tweaks are:
- Altering the footprint for the touch screen connector
- Reducing the brightness of the diagnostic LED (its BRIGHT)
- Alter the footprint for the USB socket"

Unfortunately, size limitation is something can not be upgrade without a full frame upgrade.
I stumbled upon the idea to cad design the existing Duplicator/Creator Chinese clone since these printers are widely available.
Having owned one of these printer past few years, I've came across many issues facing the clone printer. I believe I've found practical solution to address many issues including automatic level, extruder head, electronic compatibility to 12V power output.
Would like your support to further deliver a trouble free, 3D printing to the community.

28,28,"If you would like to try out the game, you can do so. But keep in mind that it's still in alpha, and will have a lot of bugs. It's currently going through a lot of code refactoring, so saving and loading is very unstable.
Join the google group for a link & and access to the Alpha on android here.
iOS is finally open due to the initial support of the Kickstarter! Thank you everyone, and you can access the TestFlight demo here.
You will have to join the discord so that you can get access in the future.
You somehow managed to get onto a page completely dedicated to a game about potatoes killing each other.
Glad you're here though!
Welcome to DicTater, a 4X strategy game about potatoes taking over the world. 
It will be released on iOS and Android. That's right, it's a mobile game. 
But don't worry, it's not going to be one of those dumb spend-1000-hours-waiting-or-pay-50-bucks-to-progress games. It's PC quality gameplay built for the mobile phone. An actual game for the bloated mobile market.
Unlike most of the 4X games that you may have played, this one is about potatoes.
DicTater comes with special potato-themed mechanics, like deep-frying your troops, saltiness, and of course sacrificing parts of your potato population to keep the potato gods happy.
But there are also the mechanics that are expected to come with a 4X strategy game.
Your main currency will be, of course, potatoes. To train potato troops, you need potatoes. To continue certain events, you will need potatoes. To sacrifice potatoes to the potato gods, you will need potatoes.
There are various ways of generating more potatoes, but a primary way of doing so are building farms. As you progress there will be more than just farms to build: factories and administration buildings will help drive the way. 
Basic building in DicTater!
To unlock these future buildings you will have to do research in different tech trees. With currently over 100 different technologies to unlock, you'll certainly have to advance to keep up with your rivals.
Unlocking research from the 3 research trees.
Don't forget the troops! Inspired from EU4, there are three types of troops (with variable potato costs) that you can get: Infantry, Ranged, and Artillery. The battle system is simple enough for most people to get for a mobile phone, but strategy will still apply based on the geography of the land; like rivers, banks, and towers.
3 Types of Troops in DicTater.
But who are you attacking, you may ask? Other potatoes of course! The potatoes of DicTater have become more segregated over time, with the different potato cultivars skirmishing over who should reign supreme. Will you win? In-game you will rival and align with different cultivars, affecting who revolts in empire and who welcomes your rule.
3 of the 6 enemy potato factions that you'll encounter in DicTater!
To give each playthrough some replayability, different events pop up. There are HUNDREDS of different events. And if you purchase the Count of Chips tier (and above), you will be able to design one yourself.
Lots of events... Hundreds!
Now here's a generic mobile game trailer that's edited pretty alright.
DicTater's development blog also has a lot of information on the game as well, if you're so inclined.

Alright, you probably skipped to here first. That's fine, let's see what rewards we have!
Expansions will come with both free and paid updates to the game so that all players will always have something new to play with. Keep in mind that the base game will be free, but all future expansions will not be free. 
 Starting at $75, you'll be able to throw your creative ideas into the mix. Make an event chain (up to 5 events) to create a short story about potatoes.
And now we get to the big buck tiers. For $100 you'll be able to get all future expansions for free, whether that's all 5 or all 200. It could be a very good investment.
And don't forget, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!
Monuments are buildings from the past that show up in the map. They take an entire tile and can't be altered. They're just there to look at and fight over. You can get one dedicated to you. Read more about monuments here.
More importantly, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!
The main mechanic of the gameplay loop is the fact that you have to sacrifice potatoes to the potato gods. But imagine if you were a potato god. That's right, you can be a god. You can pay to be god. This will be the ONLY TIME where you can pay to win the game (since you become immortalized as God-Tier instantly). Anyone will be able to unlock you by playing a long time in-game. Your role in the discord server will give you access to a command to flex on anyone.
What's more, you get a CUSTOM POSTCARD!

 Don't think too long to decide... custom postcards take a lot of effort to make.
Read about the monument stretch goal on the blog post!
But how is DicTater's release going to actually work? Do I have to pay for the game? When is it going to be released? How are you going to communicate with backers? Is $1900 going to actually get the project anywhere? Why did you spend so long making a game about dumb potatoes?
What Am I Paying for Again?
I originally made this genre of game because all of the mobile ""strategy"" games listed on the Google Play Store were really just pay-to-win castle builders. 
The real strategy games that I liked were those on the PC, like Europa Universalis 4 and Civilization 5. So I emulated their monetization strategy with a few tweaks. 
The base game will be free. The expansions will be paid so that you only pay for what you want to play. Every major update will have a free update and a paid expansion, but bug fixes and other small additions are to be expected. There will also be different cosmetics to purchase for your potato character that have no effect on gameplay.
Testing & Release Schedule
Backers who have donated to the ""Hot Potato"" tier and above, and those who have already tested the game will be invited to alpha tests as the game is balanced and updated through development. 
The current plan is to release at least the beta of the game within the first two quarters of 2020. This will be as close to bug-free as possible, and changes will be based on game balance instead of crashes.
During that time, backers who have donated to the ""Stellar Spud"" and above will be able to test upcoming expansions and new builds of the game.
Afterwards, the game will be released fully after a stable enough version is made, hopefully in Q3 of 2020. A second expansion may come along with this launch.
Communication with Backers
I can't realistically spend all my time relaying every possible thing that happens behind the scenes AND make progress on the game. That being said, I will report to the community with:
Direct chats with potato friends in the fantabulous Discord!
Weekly reports on progress of the game's development every Saturday via the website's development blog & built-in Kickstarter messages.
A monthly message that lists all the progress made that particular month, and any special community events/notices that may come up.

Where the Money Goes
Software subscriptions and some extra hardware will help expedite the development process & build onto some platforms. Basic tier everything can only get me so far. This will be approximately 55% of the money that comes from the Kickstarter's finish.
The game will require a minimal amount of servers to send out promo codes for the game. No multiplayer is planned, but greater and greater goals will allow for more ""multiplayer"" options. This will be approximately 15% of the money that comes from the Kickstarter's finish.
I also don't want to do all of the art myself as I go forward. Being able to hire freelancer artists here and there will be helpful. This will probably happen if the project gets more than the original goal.
Besides that, all development has so far been out of my pocket, so a little bit of the money will help me eat food while I work on this. In other words, I'll be working on this game for you to play instead of working a part-time job at Walmart.
If I were to somehow get much more than the $2000 from Kickstarter, then more ambitious goals for the game can be set, along with more ambitious expenditures.
P.S. If you haven't gotten the pun yet, I can't help you."
29,29,"Last year, my friend Bizhan Khodabandeh and I put together the swankest new edition of Dracula for our bookshelves with Dracula Illustrated, utilizing Bizhan's fantastic illustrations and my book design.
We're following it up by resurrecting another classic of the macabre--
Mary Shelley's iconic Frankenstein. 
Bizhan's wraparound cover art
Who was Mary Shelley? The daughter of British philosopher William Godwin and early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary's immortality was created during a foreboding storm, candlelight, and German ghost stories...
Frankenstein came to life one stormy night in Lake Geneva, when Mary and her friends dared one another to create the scariest tale. Mary out frightened Lord Byron, her husband Percy Bysshe, and the aspiring John Polidori with Frankenstein, the tale of a scientist who creates life from the dead--and is haunted and tortured for his folly in playing God.
The novel is widely considered the first science fiction book, but has clearly made a space in the horror genre.
Design subject to tweaks before production
Frankenstein Illustrated is the second in The Drawn Word's Illustrated series of classics, once again featuring Bizhan's art in a limited edition paperback. Like Dracula, it comes in a matching 5.5"" x 8.5"" size.
This time, we're also producing a series of three hardcovers, each divided into the three ""volumes"" of the novel as originally printed, that you get (along with a signed paperback) in the Volume level. 
These volumes feature different cover designs and also include Bizhan's illustrations.
Each stretch goal will add a new illustration, until we hit 6, and then gains an academic essay by myself on the evolution of Frankenstein in media. The cherry on top is metallic foil stamping on the cover of the paperback.
  And after that? We unlock levels to pledge for Bizhan's original art, such as: 
WHO THE HECK ARE WE?
Bizhan Khodabandeh teaches at Virginia Commonwealth University's Robertson School of Media and Culture and freelances under the name Mended Arrow. As an illustrator/design he has been recognized by various institutions such as: The Society of Illustrators, The American Institute of Graphic Arts, Creativity International, the International Design Awards, Adbusters, and Creative Quarterly. More of his work can be found at www.mendedarrow.com
I also teach at VCU, in the Communication Arts department, where I specialize in media and comic book studies. As you can imagine, Frankenstein--particularly the James Whale adaptation--comes up in many of my classes."

When the owners of Fire Lizard Games read the first edition eBook of Examination, they knew they'd love to incorporate the story into one of their games. After broaching the subject of using it as the thematic setting for the Adventure Module in BASE: a CaRdPG Perry Hartree was excited by the prospect and granted the rights to Fire Lizard Games.
Check out BASE: a CaRdPG here!
Re-imagining
After Perry Hartree granted the rights to Fire Lizard Games for use in BASE: a CaRdPG, Perry wanted to know more about how they developed and formatted (particularly for books in print). Throughout a handful of conversations, Fire Lizard Games agreed to assist Perry in getting greater exposure for Examination (via this Kickstarter, connections, editing, etc.). During this process, it allowed Perry to include some details that were not in the original eBook, as well.
Make 100
The 100 limited hardbound editions of Examination are in the $4 and $14 tiers. The $14 tier includes BASE: a CaRdPG at a discount."
34,34,"Despite the economic, political, cultural and psychological changes the world have undergone over the past decade, the Nigerian education system is still based on the National Policy on Education (NPE) introduced in 1977. This is a great shame for the country as a whole and an act of structural violence on the part of the government and every capable human being (not just Nigerians) who is able to act against such violence. Proper education is a God given right that every human being independent of race, nationality, gender, and socio-economic class should be afforded. As for Nigerians in particular, who fall victim to this outdated educational structure, they often lack the core and personal skill sets needed to affect the Nigerian society in a meaningful way as well as contribute to the world at large. As a result of this, high unemployment rates among past and recent graduates remain a major issue in the country. What is even more striking is that high unemployment covaries with almost every major issue facing the country today – rise of extremist groups (Boko Haram), youth violence, lack of infrastructure, lack of professional training, corruption, mental illness, corrupted legal system and so forth.
 To make matters worse, those who are unable to participate in the educational system fall into illiteracy as business minded and limited centers for knowledge – libraries, community centers and religious centers - lack the most basic resources in which self-education can be achieved. According to a survey conducted by the Federal Government of Nigeria and UNICEF the average rate of literacy for women in Nigeria is at an all-time low of 27% and for men 51%.
 In order to move the educational landscape of Nigeria in the right direction, independent of the government of Nigeria, O.B.A. Public Library of Nigeria’s objective is to provide a free, world-class, public library which will be a center for curating and disseminating knowledge in Nigeria’s most poverty stricken areas. This project will begin in Lagos, Nigeria and later spread to the entire country. Besides providing basic services available in almost any library in countries around the world, such as the issuing of free library membership, the borrowing and returning of children’s and academic books, journal articles, audio books, films & documentaries, access to computers for research and educational purposes, there will also be monthly lectures within different areas of academic disciplines from world class experts around the world, professional and technical workshops in which library members will be able to learn how to write a CV, business plans, use various technical softwares, data analysis, and so forth. Cultural exhibition and performances will also be available in the exhibition center of the library. Finally there will also be a research center affiliated with the library whose library members will be able to apply to be a part of the research group."
35,35,"Photography can be a catalyst for change. It was for 19 young Rwandan orphans and will be again through these dynamic photo workshops.
Help fund photo workshops for the next generation of Camera Kids. 
Founded in 2000, Through the Eyes of Children (TTEC) taught photography to a group of 19 children orphaned by the Rwandan Genocide Against the Tutsi who lived at the Imbabazi Orphanage in Mutura, Rwanda. The workshops were held over 11 years and the resulting photographs were exhibited throughout the world, including at the United Nations and at the premiere of the movie Hotel Rwanda. Funds raised through the children’s photography helped to pay their school fees and proved to them that people value their perspective and want to see Rwanda through their eyes. 
Today, these children, now adults, are extending the project’s mission. The photographers, or “Camera Kids” as they were called, are paying it forward, teaching photography to other vulnerable children around the world. 
This Kickstarter campaign is being launched to raise funds for photo workshops with other vulnerable children from around the world. The photo workshops will be led by three of the original Camera Kids, Mussa Uwitonze, Gadi Habumugisha and Jean Bizimana.These workshops will be captured in a documentary film by the award-winning director, Beth Murphy, and GroundTruth Films. 
Two photo workshops have already been held in the United States: working with Haitian Immigrant teenagers in New Jersey and with foster children in Boston. More workshops are planned for 2019 around the world.
Campaign
Photography has played a role in the life, education and careers of these Rwandan orphans, creating a pathway to memories and community after all was lost in the genocide. Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana believe that they can create the same impact on the lives of other children.
In 2011, the original Camera Kids started a “pay it forward” program by teaching photography to other Rwandan children. In July 2018, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana expanded the program and led workshops with Haitian Immigrant teenagers and American Foster Children. 
Through this Kickstarter campaign, we plan to conduct additional photo workshops with other vulnerable children throughout the world. Each workshop will be 4-7 days in length and will be both immersive and fun for a group of 20 children at a time. Partnerships with organizations working with vulnerable children in each location have already been established, including Worldwide Orphans who serves thousands of children around the globe and The Home for Little Wanderers in the United States.
Select photos from each workshop will be shared on the Camera Kids Instagram account to showcase the work of the children and their photos will be curated for inclusion in photo exhibitions with each partner organization.
This Kickstarter campaign is to fund Camera Kids’ photo workshops and document the process for a feature documentary film by the GroundTruth Project.
Your contribution today will cover the costs of travel, materials and salaries for Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana. 
 PROJECT HISTORY 
Through the Eyes of Children (TTEC) was conceived by photographer David Jiranek (1958 –2003) in the year 2000 in collaboration with The Imbabazi Orphanage. The Orphanage was established in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide Against the Tutsi by American Roz Carr, who was 82 years old when she dedicated herself to care for hundreds of orphaned children. David began the TTEC photo project at Imbabazi with annual four-week photographic workshops centered on the importance of the children’s perspective and experience. Nineteen children, ranging in ages from eight to 18, were given disposable cameras and taught the fundamentals of photography as they documented themselves and their community. Initially, their photos were developed locally in Rwanda and displayed on the orphanage walls. Since then, the same children have participated in annual workshops from 2000 – 2011. Their photographic body of work documents their lives in Rwanda as the country was rebuilding.
In the Spring of 2001, after David completed his first workshop, he invited photographer Kristen Ashburn, PR professional Jenifer Howard and brand strategist Joanne McKinney to help. When David tragically died in 2003, the project continued on through their volunteer efforts. Today, three of the original camera kids, Mussa Uwitonze, Gadi Habumugisha and Jean Bizimana, stepped up to lead TTEC for the future.
The children’s work has been widely recognized and has been exhibited around the world in such prestigious venues as the United Nations in New York, the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, The Holocaust Museums of Houston, Texas, and Naples, Florida and at several universities throughout the U.S. and in Europe. Over the course of 15+ years and through the sale of the children’s photography, significant funds were raised to fund the secondary school education for all of the children at the orphanage.  
Check out the work of the original Rwandan camera kids here: 
Today, the Camera Kids are adults, living and working in Rwanda - a number in the field of photography. As this project comes full circle, Gadi, Mussa and Bizimana, once child photographers and Camera Kids themselves, are bringing their work, their lives, their achievements and their hope for tomorrow directly to the next generation of Camera Kids.  They are a true success story of how love, education -- and photography -- can transform lives.
For a historical perspective on the photo workshops, watch this video:
 Why This, Why Now? 
What started as a project to bring happiness into the lives of orphans has morphed into a powerful, life-changing means of work, income and artistic expression. A number of the original Camera Kids have gone on to embrace photography in their careers. Some work as photojournalists for organizations such as Reuters, staff photographers for Starwood Hotels and others work as photo tourism guides, wedding photographers and studio photographers. It is a natural progression of the Project to pay it forward and help other vulnerable youth throughout the world realize the power  of sharing their story through the lens and eyes of children. The resulting documentary film will be a powerful message of hope and transformation that the world should see.
Why Kickstarter?
As a very small, all-volunteer organization, Through the Eyes of Children has dedicated itself to teaching photography to other vulnerable children throughout the world. When this project started, no one thought that photography would change lives -- but it did. Now that the Camera Kids are grown up and ready to take this social impact project to a broader, global scale, they need your help! Your donation will help to cover the necessary funds to run the photo workshops and then to help fund the documentary that will follow their progress. 
Every dollar you donate to this Kickstarter campaign will go directly to support the photo workshops.

-solve the hunger crisis
-reduce trash
-save environment
Just imagine to get rid of all four problems just with one idea. That´s what this project is about.
to produce just 1 kilogram of meat, you need 6 kilograms of corn, 6 kilograms of grass and lots of protein. And of course not to forget you need about 6000 liters of water! Considering the high amount of meat that is produced, it is an unbelievable number of resources we need for the protein. Adding another fact might make you rethink the way you consume protein: About 50% of the fish we catch isn’t used for human consumption but for feeding our kettle for example. It´s simply inefficient. Environmentally and social.
There are huge problems because of trash in Africa. Not just Africa. Around the whole globe there is a massive trash issue. In Kamerun, were i come from , where I grew up, there is just a single waste disposal company. Consequently the people just throw their waste on the streets, which causes a massive trash crisis.
We want to solve exactly these problems with growing and selling the larvae of the black soldier fly as alternative to use these as animal feed, because it´s rich on protein, thus we don´t have to overfish our seas and reduce the trash as well.
With the money I get from you guys, I want to buy a biochemical reactor by the Hermetia company to produce the larvae.
Thank you very much for helping to save the planet we live on and to start a revolution on the way we consume our Proteins"

 Benghazi – Bergen-Belsen is an original play inspired by a novel of the same name (see at Amazon). Set in 1945, when the Nazi holocaust turned onto the Jews of Libya, the play gives voice to an aspect that is conspicuously absent from prevalent stories of the Jewish holocaust. By citing the marginalized racial politics of the holocaust, the show urges a reconsidering of both historical and contemporary religious, cultural, and racial oppression and violence. It does this with a contemporary approach, a uniquely multicultural cast (of Israeli, Palestinian, Moroccan and Italian origins), world fusion music score and modern, artistic light design. 
  Benghazi – Bergen-Belsen is narrated in the voice of Silvana Hajaj, an ambitious young Jewish feminist from Benghazi, Libya. Silvana is transported with her family to the Bergen-Belsen, Germany concentration camp. There, Silvana meets Rebecca, a young Dutch Jew, and the play tracks their encounter which is layered with cultural and sexual tensions.
After being caught stealing water Silvana and Rebecca are locked in a shack where they must decide - within an hour - which one of them shall be executed. Rebecca asks Silvana to tell her to use her last minutes to tell her a story, the story of her family from Benghazi in North Africa to Bergen-Belsen, in the heart of Germany. The timeline shifts between Silvana's journey and her destination - the concentration camp. Tensions between Silvana and Rebecca culminate in a compelling experience, intricate and laden with lust, dreams, fears, and questions of femininity.
Although the play is set 70 years ago, the performance is rendered in a contemporary aesthetic.

The story of Libyan and other non-white Jewish communities continues to be ignored in the present day. Underscoring the contemporary urgency of the story, the play features both historical and present-day images of New York, Europe, Syria, Africa, and the Middle East. Rather than reconstruct the past, the scenic and costume design express contemporary society’s continuing role in a long tradition of cultural repression and oppression.

We have been working on the bases of this project for a year. We combine it with our own works to be able to face the economic cost that it supposes. The current global pandemic has led us to delay the launch. But we want to take advantage of this situation and continue progressing.
We start with a reduced catalog to be able to review the post-sale management process and thus ensure the greatest detail and the highest quality. But our objective for the last semester of this year is to triple the current catalog with products of different kinds within the context of traveling.
Llevamos un año trabajando en las bases del proyecto. Lo combinamos con nuestros propios trabajos para poder afrontar el coste económico que supone. La actual pandemia global nos ha llevado a demorar el lanzamiento, cosa que queremos aprovechar para seguir progresando con el proyecto.
Empezamos con un catálogo reducido de productos para ser capaces de revisar el proceso de gestión postventa y asegurar así el mayor detalle y la máxima calidad. Pero nuestro objetivo para el último cuatrimestre de este año es triplicar el catálogo actual con apuestas de diferentes índoles dentro del contexto del “viaje”. "
39,39,"Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is a brand-new platformer game for the NES. After running a successful campaign in 2017 to fund production of Eskimo Bob: Starring Alfonzo, I've been hard at work creating something even bigger and better. This time, Bob is missing, and it's up to Alfonzo to find him. Great care was taken to preserve everything that made the original so much fun, while at the same time creating something new and exciting. I'm extremely proud at how this game has turned out.
I will also be porting the game to Nintendo 3DS and Steam, complete with achievements. All backers for the digital tier or above will be given the choice between a 3DS or Steam download key in addition to the NES ROM. These ports will be released after the NES launch, later in 2019.
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is packed with tons of new features and content!
Four different playable characters
Over 90 levels split into 6 episodes  
More than 30 types of enemies to encounter  
Seven unique boss battles
Unlockable boss rush mode  
World map for level selection
Secret exits and branching paths
Password function to save progress
Two-player melee mode
And so much more...
Programming for this game is already complete. The game has been in development for the past year and is fully playable. All that is left to do now is produce physical copies of the game on cartridge, as well as print boxes and manuals, which is why your help is needed!
In Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure, you take the role of Alfonzo on a quest to find your missing best friend, Bob. Knowing that Bob's favorite food is fish, you decide to collect as many fish as you can while searching for your friend. With your trusty stick by your side, travel through over 90 levels filled with puzzles, traps, and enemies around every corner. Luckily, you aren't alone on your adventure! You will meet new friends along the way, each with different abilities to help you on your quest. These include the power-punching Magnus, the near-invulnerable Fenwood, and the sword-wielding Girl.
Use these four characters to explore over 90 levels, collecting fish and battling baddies along the way! You can even choose a character and face off against your friends in Two-Player Melee Mode!
Solve puzzles and avoid traps!
Explore dangerous castles and caverns!
Travel across 6 different maps, each with branching paths and secret exits!
Do battle against seven unique and deadly bosses.
Challenge a friend in two-player melee mode!
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure will be available both as a ROM and in physical cartridge form! Cartridges will be available in both ""Classic Grey"" and ""Snowy White"" colors. There are even bundle options available if you'd like to receive more than one copy of the game.

Soundtrack
You can even get the 24-track soundtrack for Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure on either CD or vinyl LP!
Vinyl will be limited to one pressing. Any vinyl left after the campaign may be sold via another method.
The original Eskimo Bob was a 40 kilobyte NROM game, similar in size and scope to Super Mario Bros. This is the most basic type of NES game. For Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure, I wanted to push things further, so I decided to use a mapper to allow me to use a technique called bank switching.
The NES can only access 40 kilobytes of data at a time, no matter how large a game is. 32 kilobytes of this is program (PRG) data, and 8 kilobytes is graphical (CHR). Bank switching allows for multiple banks of PRG and CHR data to be accessed from within the same ROM, effectively tricking the NES into accessing more data than it was originally designed to handle. This technique was used for most games released later in the NES's lifecycle.
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure is a much bigger game than Eskimo Bob.
In the case of Alfonzo, I used 4 PRG banks and 16 CHR banks, bringing the total size of the ROM up to 256 kilobytes. In terms of the original NES, this is comparable in size to games like Super Mario Bros 2, Zelda 2, or Punch Out. Using these extra banks has given me space to include more levels, characters, enemies, and environments than I had in the original. It also allowed me to add new features such as world maps, secret exits, cut scenes, and animated backgrounds.
A prototype cartridge of Alfonzo has been thoroughly tested on real NES hardware as well as various clone systems, including the RetroUSB AVS, Retro-Bit RES+, Hyperkin RetroN HD, and RetroN 5. The only system found to be incompatible with the game was the RetroN 5.
The cartridge contains a multi-region CIC, allowing it to be played worldwide on both NTSC and PAL systems. The game is also coded to recognize which type of system it is running on, using different timing settings for each region. This means the game will look and sound great, no matter where you play it.
The ROM will run on any emulator that supports mapper 11, including Mesen, FCEUX, Nestopia, and most other modern NES emulators. It has been tested and works with both Everdrive and Powerpak. I have also compiled an MMC1 version of the game, allowing for compatibility with emulators that do not support mapper 11. Both versions of the ROM will be included with your download.
Spoony Bard Productions is a one-man team run by me, Tomas Guinan. I've been a part of the NES community since 1997, but it was 20 years before I created first NES game, Eskimo Bob, in 2017. Since then, I've also developed the NES version of Galf for Limited Run Games, and am now working on releasing Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure.
To say that I made Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure by myself wouldn't be entirely true. There is one song in the game that was composed by Elijah, my 12-year-old son. It's actually the final song featured in the game's trailer! If you're interested in hearing more of his work, check out Mango Schmango on Youtube.
I would also like to thank my wife, Shannon, who has been the most loving and supportive partner/beta tester I could ever ask for. I never could have done this without her constant support and encouragement."

3D Model to 3D Print
Innovation:
We’ve taken lessons from the past and incorporated them into a high quality tool which should last for years.
Non-leaking – Due to our true-fit & self-sealing tip technologies
Non-Jamming – Due to our tip/tube design architecture
Stable Heating control – Due to our dynamic temperature algorithm
Heat draft protection – Due to convection insulation housing
Fire protections – In the Tip, Heated Build Platform, and Firmware
Audible Alarm (option) – in case of thermal runaway (possible fire) detection
Threaded sensor mountings – Further reducing opportunity for thermal runaway
Efficient Cooling & Insulation – Keeping your spindle bearings cool and protecting your CNC
Integrated filament filter – A must for a CNC working environment to prevent particulate jams
Simplified Touch Screen Interface – A child could operate this tool 
Innovative Print-Head Assembly
Accuracy:
Accurate Results -- 5mm calibration test print
Reliability:
We have hundreds of hours of test time on our prototypes, including very long print jobs of over 40 hours with no problems at all. 
Requirements: 
Any 4-axis (or more ) CNC milling machine and a sliced 3D model; However, if we get enough requests we may be able to accommodate a 3-axis CNC by designing the 4th axis driver into our controller box before the end of the campaign, but your machine controller software must still support 4-axis. This would then be an new 3DPA reward since it requires a different Controller box and additional cable. Please contact us with all requests ... We aim to please. 
The 3DPA is intended as an accessory attachment for your CNC mill to be used like any other accessory tool. To simplify things further we'll even include a model converter which will convert g-code models originally intended for 3D printers to run on your CNC with your normal CNC software. That way you can download models directly from thingiverse.com or any other model storage website, slice them with any program you want, and print them with your existing CNC software; or you can simply create your own. 
How close are we to finishing?
We’re very close … We’ve been working on this project for over 10 months now and our fully functioning prototypes perform extremely well; with hundreds of hours of test time, we feel good about this product. We still need to clean things up a bit for production, so the final products may look slightly different than shown here, and we may refine a few things, but that's about it. 
See an early prototype test run below. We sped it up to save time.

41,41,"""Layers"" is a collaboration between  photographer, Asiko,  floral designer, Jo Wise and make- up artist Jade Soar. This beautiful collection of powerful portraits explores and challenges our conceptions of beauty and ageing.
Women from various backgrounds aged between 19 and 90 years were photographed in front of an evolving flower wall during a three week period. Layers of fresh flowers were added to the wall as the project progressed. The added layers represent the growth and depth gained through life’s experiences, the ageing flowers display the passage of time.
A diverse group of women was selected and includes a scientist, a Team GB gold medal winner, a journalist, a musician, an artist and a writer. The subjects and their life stories are the backbone to the exhibition. 
You can read more about the story behind ""Layers"" here:
https://floralcircus.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/layers-a-celebration-of-women-and-nature/
We are so proud of this project, we presented the images online, along with a press release at the end of January, within the first two weeks of circulation it was featured on:
Huffington Post, Creative Boom & Culture Trip
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/28/layers-photo-series-celebrates-women_n_9099028.html  
We have since been invited to exhibit ""Layers"" in  three different areas. The first two coming up very soon for International Women's Day 8th March.
1. The South Bank Arts Centre, London as part of the Women of the World Festival.
2. The Women's Equality Party board room in London.
3. Winter Pride Arts Award - Islington Arts Factory 16th -22nd April
We really need some help financing the printing of these portraits so we can exhibit at these hugely prestigious venues.
The printing for each exhibition is £500. 
The first two exhibitions are in less about 2 weeks time, so I have set a target for £1000.00 in 10 days. If we can raise this, we can get these images all the way to the South Bank, which would be really wonderful.
We hope you could help us achieve our goal of exhibiting these powerful images in a few weeks time.
Should we be able to exceed the minimum goal £1000  on 10 days, we could be on our way to printing a set of images for Winter Pride Art Awards in April.

42,42,"35 mm film is history. All film companies are converting to digital and if we don't upgrade our projectors, and sound your only affordable theater will close it's doors at summers end.
This theater has essentially been here for the last 35 years. At one point it was the only theater. Many of our local residents recall coming here as high school students and enjoying the 2 hour escape of cinematic adventure. Times have changed.
A movie to a child is an enlightenment of fantasy, the possibility of what they can dream about for their future. For an adult, it's an escape from work, stress of bills, everyday monotony. It gives someone that time away to get lost into someone else's world.
With the average movie ticket at the large corporate owned theaters costing $10-$12 per adult and at least $7 per child, a family of four would be looking at $34-$40 just to see a movie. That crazy price doesn't include any snacks, drinks, candy, pizza, french fries, chicken tenders, etc.(which we have, by the way.)  Whereas our ticket prices of $3.00 per person, and just $1.50 for Military, Police, and Firefighters allows a family of four at our theater to enjoy snacks, dinner, or lunch and still come in under that price.
We don't feel the need to highly inflate our prices and make it nearly impossible for hard working families to be able to have some fun and good quality family time.
The economy has taken a hard hit and down shifted into lack of funds for most of our residents of this area. WE have changed this theater into a fun, family friendly, and clean atmosphere as best we could five years ago. So let's do this. We want to say thank you for your donation. How does FREE concession, or FREE movies sound? (Unfortunately we can't match dollar to dollar or we wouldn't be getting the equipment paid for. We want to at least be able to say thank you.)
Anyone who donates $10 will get a $10 concession credit. 
Anyone who donates $25 will get 10 free movie passes 
Anyone donating $100 or more will receive a $100 credit toward a private theater rental for a birthday party, corporate event, holiday party, etc. 
Any LARGE CORPORATE donations, we can host a holiday party or seminar, etc. And your donation is a business write off. (Can contact us directly for more info.)
EVERYONE who donates will have our sincerest gratitude. 
We have donated to many community events, school fund raisers, and charity events. Any time someone comes in asking for a donation we do our very best to contribute. This area needs this theater. With that being said, we are now asking for the communities help in return. 
We MUST upgrade our 35 mm equipment into Digital Cinema. Hollywood is doing away with 35 mm film and going 100% digital. As of right now, this theater would not be able to play such great blockbusters as Transformers 4, Avengers 2, God is Not Dead, Brick Mansions, Godzilla, or Blended, to name a few. Without the films being available, this theater will have to close its doors at the end of August. 
We are not corporate. We are a mom, and dad in our 30's with 5 daughters. We don't want the community to lose its only affordable entertainment, and we don't want to lose our family business. We need your help. PLEASE help us. Help our community. It's in your hands."

Trying to progress from a local band to a national act can be hard, but we feel with the right team, and the right steps we can potentially accomplish the goals we have set for ourselves.

At the end of the day we couldn't be where we are at without the help of our amazing friends, fans and families who support our dreams and aspirations. We ask that you please donate whatever you feel comfortable to our campaign, and hey.. we might even throw in some fun rewards for the kindness!

Thanks in advance for all of the continued support for this band and we hope to see you all at our next show."

Excellent surfaces
More efficiency during the printing process – considerably less production time
The Multex4Move – new print-head technology
Der Multex4Move - die neue Druckkopf-Technologie - Kampagnentext deutsch
The Multex4Move provides for distinct improvements on several levels that open up completely new dimensions in the field of 3D printing. Due to the clever design, oozing (dripping during multiple hotend printing) is finally a thing of the past. We achieve this by only allowing our active nozzle to be in direct contact with the model.
In this campaign you can order either a Multex4Move extruder by itself, or together with proven Multirap M420 3D-Printer (as construction kit).
Quad Extruder Multex4Move
  The inactive nozzles are retracted, effectively sealed and cleaned before each new use. Color mixing and oozing is fully a thing of the past.
Multex4Move Hotends
  The four hotends have separate heating elements, temperature regulators and filament feeds and are therefore the basis for more flexibility and a considerably higher level of performance, e.g. in the case of complex printed parts. Therefore, we not only achieve more variability, but also better printing quality and diversity that have not been possible up until now – plus an extreme reduction in printing time. In this way, it is possible to print quick and stable inner structures with large nozzle diameters and flow rates. It is also possible to achieve fine surfaces by printing with a small diameter nozzle during the same print run; all of that is completely ooze-free!
Oozing-free 3D-Prints with Multex4Move
    This technology provides significant advantages when using water-soluble filament for supporting structures. The separation is clear and clean; the pulping process takes place trouble-free and provides for high-quality results.
water-soluble support structures
  The number “4” in Multex4Move stands for four nozzles that are used in parallel within a single print run. With Multex2Move, the version with two print heads, Multec has already reached series-production readiness; the enhanced version with four print heads is almost ready for production. Both print heads, Multex2Move and Multex4Move, have the same nozzle automation system and use the same cleaning process. Both functions have been tested in successful series tests for Multex2Move, and both are already ready for production in the case of Multex4Move. In the case of Multex2Move, two powerful drive steppers with steel planetary gear and 5:1-transmission provide for high-torque and slip-free feeding. The feed mechanism has been tried and tested by Multec since 2014, is fail-safe and operates the Multex2Move via a Bowden connection.
Multex Bowden-Extruder
  Due to an extremely strong feed stepper motor, the automatic feed system used for Multex4Move is also capable of transporting four filaments independently of one another.
This feed automation system has been tested on a technical level and is extremely strong, just as in the preceding models.
Two color gimbal created in a single printing session
  The fine tuning for serial development is currently taking place in two areas; firstly in the adaptation of software, and secondly in the optimization of weight and size.
As a result of this, oozing shields and cooling of nozzles when printing will no longer be necessary. No more need for elaborate software adaptations just to prevent oozing.
Easy and perfect Multi-Color-Printing
  The additional flexibility gained during the printing process allows for unprecedented possibilities - It is even possible to upgrade the Multex2Move to a Multex4Move. This is yet another advantage due to the freedom and flexibility of this design.
Thread with nut printed together
The hotends that come installed are tried and tested Multec hotends which been optimized for great printing results on the new Multex4Move with active cooling and optimized cooling elements. The nozzles can be changed quickly and easily and are available in various sizes.
Software
At the moment the Multex4Move and Multex2Move can be fully utilized with slicers that support multiple materials. At Multec we generally use Simplify3D as a slicer due to specific advantages it offers for printing with multiple materials. It allows us to utilize a parameter for the “next” X/Y” coordinate so that all hotends can be covered when the printer is in motion and not printing (Called “free travel” in Simplify3D). Using the Multex2Move or the Multex4Move in conjunction with the free printing action, you can avoid stringing between printed areas. This means that with the Multex4Move you can avoid stringing problems in single material prints as well as prints using multiple materials.  
At the moment, one of our current tasks is to build a similar feature directly into the firmware. This would add the capability of closing the hotends during “free travel” independant of the slicer being used.

The intensive cooperation and collaboration with leading scientists provides for important momentum within the scope of our own development work, and paves the path for extraordinary and innovative solutions.
This not only applies to developments like the new Multex4Move, but also for basic materials, which we have continuously worked to improve.
As an example, we would like to mention our food safe, high impact strength and high temperature PLA-HT filament.
In the end, we achieve considerably better results in all areas of the manufacturing process, whether it be quicker printing times, smoother services or – one of the main advantages of Multex4Move – precise material separation.
Multec – established 3D printer manufacturer
For many years, the 3D printer series, MULTIRAP, has stood for durable, precise and powerful 3D printers with perfectly adapted print heads that are optimized for the field of printing technology. From the beginning, the innovative power of MULTEC has been concentrated on the core of 3D printing, the extruder. After many years of experience and meticulous development work, production of the first ooze-free quad extruder has been made a reality on a worldwide level.
Multirap M420
  With this product, MULTEC is setting new benchmarks and standards that will considerably enhance the range of applications of 3D printing. This new technology not only makes the production of complex products possible, but it also provides for a massive increase in quality. Competence, expertise and high quality standards are not a matter of chance. With over 1000 printers sold, we not only possess a great wealth of experience, due to our close relationship with our customers, but we also know exactly what is being demanded in the market and where problems and opportunities lie. Our commitment and expertise are not only limited to printers and extruders, but also extend to crucial improvements in the field of filament development.
Our MULTEC PLA-HT Filament is an example of a high quality, unbreakable and high temperature resistant filament deriving from our development, currently available under “Awards” via KICKSTARTER.
MULTEC – the manufacturing concept
The focus of what we do lies in the design and further development of components for 3D printing. A key role in technology leadership is the objective. Nevertheless, we have a small in-house production area, in which we offer and handle small scale production runs.
For greater quantities and production volumes, we rely on an established and close relationship with local manufacturing partners.. Within the scope of our production, we rely and focus on “Made in Germany” for products ranging from individual components all the way to high performance industrial 3D printers
All manufacturing processes are subject to high-precision German safety standards, guidelines and certifications. Close proximity to the production site and clear, regular communication with our partners and customers are important us. Only in this way can we achieve the efficiency and high quality standards that our customers expect of us. Our focus is on the absolute reliability and durability of all components.
For consistency and reliability, we also maintain a constant supply of assorted spare parts on hand.
MULTEC stands for quality and precision - without compromise. Our target markets are currently in Europe and the USA, where we have an efficient logistics partner.

47,47,"Le projet consiste à créer une plateforme de tutorat mettant en relation les étudiants des grandes écoles françaises avec les élèves désireux d'accéder à ces mêmes écoles : HEC, ENS, Science Po, Les Mines, Polytechnique et bien d'autres.
La plateforme facilitera ainsi la rencontre entre des jeunes qualifiés prêts à investir leur temps et se déplacer jusqu'au domicile/à la bibliothèque pour faciliter la réussite des autres élèves.
Loin d'une atmosphère de compétition qui peut se retrouver dans certaines classes préparatoires, les étudiants-tuteurs créeront un milieu d'accompagnement académique d'excellence pour leurs élèves, sans les codes parfois lourds de l'enseignement en classe ""classique"".
Afin de promouvoir la qualité d'enseignement des étudiants-tuteurs et donc du service proposé par la plateforme, ils seront sélectionnés selon leur niveau d'étude et leur capacité à transmettre leurs connaissances des matières étudiées et des concours d'entrée aux grandes écoles.
Le projet possède une forte dimension d'intérêt général dans le sens où il vise à faciliter la rencontre d'une offre discrète et d'une demande parfois insatisfaite. Il n'y aura aucunement besoin pour les étudiants de se mettre en auto entrepreneur, statut jugé compliqué par beaucoup de jeunes qui préfèrent donner des cours de leur côté, comme il se fait déjà en toute légalité.
La demande d'adhésion par un étudiant-tuteur sera gratuite, chacun aura un profil détaillé pour que l'élève puisse identifier le tuteur qui correspondra le mieux au concours qu'il souhaite réussir.
Objectif à 2500 euros : création de la plateforme et de l'application mobile la plus complète possible. 
Les fonds collectés seront dédiés à la création d'une première version de la plateforme de mise en relation (mise en contact, information, géolocalisation, emploi du temps et calendrier des réservations etc.) + d'une application mobile et de sa mise en ligne. 
NB : Je percevrai l'intégralité de la collecte ; le projet a une dimension d'intérêt général, les porteurs du projet ne recevront pas un seul euro de salaire tant que celui-ci ne sera pas rentable. "
48,48,"  The Art Department is a nonprofit alternative art space from Portland, Maine, working with adults with developmental disabilities. We work with lots of mediums, from studio art, multimedia, animations, and print, to audio, film, and radio. We are an incredibly important resource in our community that encourages our artists and gives them a place where they can make art and have their voices heard. Our space includes a working studio, retail store and screening space, and  provides equipment, supplies and education so our artists can learn skills and make awesome projects. With all projects and artwork that we sell, the artists receive 75% of the sale price, with 25% going back to the program for supplies.
THE BIG IDEA!
Our big idea is to create an online news show called ""The Art Department News"" that shares the amazing things going on in our home state of Maine, and better engage in our community by interviewing incredible local heroes, working with our local radio station, investigating historical curiosities, working with local Maine filmmakers, reviewing local museums and galleries, collaborating on bigger and better public art projects, and expanding our presence throughout Portland and beyond. Our plan is to use the money from this campaign to buy a computer and camera in order to develop hands-on techniques in journalism, such as interviewing, audio, animation, and design, to bring ""The Art Department News"" to life! Most recently we started a newspaper called ""Sunny All Day News"", which inspired us to come up with the idea for the online show. ""Sunny All Day News"" focuses on all of the good news, people, and projects in our community. We would love to grow this project to include the digital news show, and become a quarterly news series in conjunction with our print newspaper.
Practicing our interviewing skills!
We work so incredibly hard to produce quality projects that enrich our artists and support them in leading fulfilling, happy, and productive lives, and we want to share our amazing Portland community with the world.  With your help and support, we will be able to showcase the amazing things that happen here in Portland every day.
We have a lot of experience in a range of media, and have confidence in our abilities to take on something big. We have worked on long term projects ranging from ongoing monthly art shows (we have had over 40 exhibits since our program started!), to writing, directing, producing, and editing over 50 video projects, which we showcase in sold out TV Show screenings at the Space Gallery in Portland. We even had a three month residency at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Maine where we created a newsroom installation and a publication called the Lazer Hotel Magazine. 
For the last two years we have been working hard on various projects with limited resources. We have been borrowing cameras from our staff, and sharing one super old computer between 25 artists. We have been able to do some really amazing things, but just think about what we could do with our own new working equipment! We need your help to bring our skills and ambitious idea to the next level. We have done so much so far- just wait until you see where we can go from here!

49,49,"Working in the arts is not an easy feat, especially for women, but for this project 5 young women have come together to put on a self-produced night of new writing. 
Coming from different backgrounds, Countries and social classes, we have decided to come together to write various short plays around the theme of home, exploring what home means to us within the current political climate. 
The reason we're putting on this night is to go against the idea that women can't work. With around only 10% of theatre in the UK being written and produced by women, we decided to produce our own writing night, celebrating women's ideas beyond the stereotypes we are expected to withhold as female-identifying creatives. 
This night means celebrating women and progression, simply to show women have the will and talent to work in any way they can. We endeavour to develop from our current project and reach out to more artists from working class and BAME backgrounds. Your donations will give us the means to carry out this night of new writing, thus allowing us to work...and isn't that what its all about? 
As a group we are beyond excited to carry out this project, to learn and grow as a team, but most importantly to use our skills as writers to put on a thought provoking and enthralling night of fringe theatre. 
What the money will be going toward: 
1) £130 for renting the space 
2) £50 for set design 
3) £25 for posters 
4) £25 for room hire
5) £15 for brochures "
50,50,"My son attends Dorris Place Elementary, a neighborhood public school in the Elysian Valley neighborhood. Our school is a Title 1 school (more than half of the students qualify for free or reduced cost lunches) with more than a quarter of the students classified as English language learners. I wanted to fill a gap and provide an opportunity for gifted and engaged students to challenge themselves with a writing program.
With the support of the principal, teachers and parents, I organized a 12-week writing course, meeting once a week in the school library an hour before school starts. This opportunity is completely free for the students, who are not required to come, nor are they graded. But each week the children have showed up, eager to learn and share and work.
After teaching this class for the first time last year, I realized the gifts of learning and teaching and sharing flow both from me to the students and from them back to me. After more than three decades of writing (as a student, then as a journalist, novelist and editor) I have learned a few things about writing — mostly the hard way — so feel lucky to have the opportunity to reach students early in their writing careers and share with them some of what I have learned (especially about discipline, the non-fatal nature of hard work, overcoming fear and insecurity, building a community of writers and showing respect to each other). In turn the young writers have surprised me with the sophistication of their ideas, and the power of imaginary beings to express emotions in ways that young people are often not allowed to in real life. We are nearly ready to share another collection of stories with you. About a third of the writers are students who participated last year and have clearly continued to push themselves. The other two thirds of the class are new to this process, and have chosen on their own to participate. In order to manifest something tangible from our writing work — a published book — we need funds to pay for printing costs. We have already raised nearly $1000 from selling copies of the book we published last year, so we are looking for support to raise another $4000, (happy to say this is less than we needed to raise last year). As we did last year, we will use funds we earn from those sales to purchase new books for our school library. Oh and of course we’ll gift copies of our own book too.
(You can check out how NPR covered the interesting backstory of the library itself, as parents transformed it from a shuttered unused resource into something extraordinary).
The kids have delivered. And in the process we have learned about writing, about fruit trees and sharing, about how hard it is to write and revise a story and about what we can do if we set our minds to it.
I hope you will join me to support these writers. Your money will continue our powerful process: first the funds will pay for the book printing, then when we sell those books, we will use the proceeds to buy more books from other authors, which can help inspire more Dorris Place Writers, who then may produce more books. Imagine the dividends.
Please help me show these kids that the power of community is as wondrous as the power of books. I thank you and the Dorris Place writers thank you."

52,52,"I've been working back towards this for years.
Blackbird was ""my"" comics character going back to my high school days in the 1990s, a teenage vampire superhero who soon changed into a 1940s pulp crimefighter, and then a late '30s superhero who embraced my love of all things old school. I self-published one issue of a black and white comic book in 2000, and just haven't gotten around to fully rebooting him.
Then, life happened, and I put Blackbird on the back burner.
In the past five years, I've started writing two different types of projects: the Eagle Force Pulps starring Lee Fine, aka the Cat, which got me back to writing fiction, and a series of war documentaries for my friends at Lionheart Film Works. In that time, I've researched and written about several wars, including World War I and II, and developed a work ethic that lets me laugh in the face of deadlines.
It is time for Blackbird.
Who is Blackbird? Some of my Eagle Force fans have seen him teased, and this is going to be a distinctly unrelated version, in his own continuity.
Blackbird is Adam Durant, an aspiring radio actor in the city of New Bremen, who is forced into the life of a crimefighter when his father is attacked by an old nemesis.
Now, what is Blackbird to me? It's a love letter to the old Republic movie serials, my favorite vintage radio shows, Will Eisner's The Spirit and some of the best early comic books. Blackbird is even more to me, though: it's a chance for me to reconnect with my father in print, who lived to work in radio, and died nine years ago.
Blackbird: Flight of Death, is written in a pulp style under the gun of a looming deadline. This isn't meant to be high art, or great literature: this is meant to be an entertaining, character-based, action-packed read that doesn't let up.

The Fox said, ""I will eat that chicken.""
Maybe not a direct quote, but not hard to imagine. If a fox could talk. FOX FARM NEEDS A CHICKEN COOP! Help us protect these vulnerable, helpless, homeless chickens! We have a 12'x12' coop on a slab planned, with a generous chicken run. The estimated cost is $5,500.
First, a little background. Fox Farm sits on the 2.5 acres of Hapeman Ranch, a former walnut orchard established in the 1920's. Though the black walnuts are mostly gone now, the orchard has diversified with over 100 various fruit and nut trees. It's irrigated by a catfish pond for the rich nutrients in the fish waste, and no toxins have been used on this property for over 25 years. Nestled amid housing subdivisions not two miles from downtown Riverside, the property furtively coexists with the encroaching suburban development that surrounds it.
I'm Scott Berndt. I started Fox Farm with the Hapemans to restore this property as a working farm. I named it after a pair of grey foxes that mate here and call it home. I plant seasonal row crops that I have sold to the Riverside Food Co-op, and have donated produce and plants to various local nonprofit and community organizations. I have already done a couple of successful community events.
Recent Fox Farm events
Now I would like to add happy, naturally fed, healthy egg-laying chickens to this here farm outfit. I have 15 years of experience raising them on my grandparents' ranch in South Dakota. And I just love chickens. Chickens whose skinny necks won’t end up in the jaws of our happy, wild and healthy grey foxes. The poor chickens wouldn't survive an evening in the current coop.

And the Chicken said, ""Whoa, what now?""
These are guileless birds. FOX FARM NEEDS A CHICKEN COOP! What I plan is a pre-built shed from Home Depot to save on expenses. Nothing too fancy. Just sturdy enough to last and keep the hens safe. I will also build a good sized outside run with strong wire on the sides and top to keep the foxes' neighbors, the raccoons, from climbing over. Here's a picture of the building I'll convert to a coop by adding nest boxes and roosts.
New Secure Chicken Coop
I'll build an exterior chicken run attached to the coop, with a door for the chickens to enter and exit.
Chicken Run - but mine will have a roof also.
It will be similar to this chicken run attached to the bar, but I will put a strong roof on top. Raccoons, foxes, owls and hawks will not get to my chickens!
And finally...the chickens will be driving a tractor. Sort of driving. The chickens will keep the bug and weed population under control under a ""chicken tractor."" A chicken tractor is a movable coop that you wheel to different spots to let the chickens dig, scratch, and eat weeds and bugs. This way they roam but are safely caged. And they leave droppings to fertilize the patch where they forage. Here's a picture. 
Chicken Tractor
Detailed use of the funds:
10x12 concrete pad - $1500.00
10x12 - prebuilt shed from home depot $2800.00
Wire, poles, hardware for chicken run and Chicken Tractor - $850.00

55,55,"A few months back, I created the game 128k and published it online on the classic, but not very active website Newgrounds.com. It was a game where you'd search though an old Macintosh computer to find a hidden password. But it wasn't just a game you played in the game, so to speak. 
If you would find yourself with an old computer today, and found something you didn't quite understand, what would you do? Google it on your smartphone, right?
128k was built on that premise, and you had to use the real life internet to solve problems in the game. Even send email to an actual email adress. Feel free to try it out here!
It didn't take long until the positive reviews started pouring in, asking for a more in-depth, longer sequel. And with the help of Kickstarter, I hope to do just that with 256k. Don't worry, it's just a temporary name.

I'm studying library and information science and will graduate after next semester. I have taken classes in game design and have a bachelor's degree in screenwriting and video game writing. With 256k, I combine all three educations for the best gaming experience.
Unfortunately, it's not free to create a longer, more in-depth PC game. But it doesn't have to be expensive. I am asking for 5000 Swedish crowns, about 566 American dollars; just enough to cover my expenses.
Publishing the game on Steam - $100
Hosting a website required for the game - $50
Hiring cheap voice actors - $150 
PR, showing people that the game exists - $200
Kickstarter percentage - $56
Energy drinks - $10
The first 100 backers backing with 50 SEK will get the game at launch. If you missed the 100 cap, you can pledge 70 SEK to get the game. 
For 200 SEK, you get your name in the game! There's a part in the game where you are searching through an email account, and if you'd like, you can be one of the few contacts. Of course, you also receive the game. 
At 350 SEK you can design a puzzle in the game together with me. You can come up with an idea for a puzzle and a solution, and I will implement it in the game. You will also get credit for it in the game's credits. "

And More!!
By crowdfunding MWDH, I will be able to afford additional assets and partial voice acting for the game! 
I will also be able to dedicate more time toward art and writing for the game and hire assistants to speed up the process! Hopefully leading to a much more polished game in a shorter amount of time. Because this project has become so big, crowdfunding the game will also make it possible for a F2P version to exist so that everyone can experience a full playthrough of the game.
Where is my money going?
❤ Art Assets and Writing: A large chunk of the funding is going toward Art creation. Background commissions, and hiring assistants to help with artwork. 
Despite being a one man team, I will be paying myself for writing. Why? Paying myself fairly as well ensures that I can spend more time on the project without worry. this money will also count as contingency/safety net money. if something goes wrong or if I need extra for certain assets, this money can help pay for it.
❤ Voice Acting: another chunk of the games funding is going toward voice talent! Hiring talented voice acting costs a lot of money! This game will be partially voiced. Why only partial? It would be extremely irresponsible and unwise to fund voice acting without a complete wordcount of the game!
❤ Programming: a lot of the basic programming has already been done for the demo! But since i am not a coder i will be hiring an experienced programmer in order to make the game more polished, run smoothly, and help me out with the work that has already been completed.
❤ Music: Several tracks will be commissioned by a talented composer to make the sound of the game just as magical as the story! 
❤ Kickstarter Rewards and Goodies: Unfortunatley merch doesn't grow on trees! In order to pay for the rewards some money would need to go toward it as well!
❤ Kickstarter fees: Kickstarter takes about 8-10% of the money earners for processing fees! 
6400 USD [REACHED!!!]
As of right now everyone has one basic pose with multiple outfits, If I meet this stretch goal I will add a second pose to the heroes and villains.
 6900 USD [REACHED!!!]
This stretch goal adds additional musical tracks to the game! The main heroes will get battle versions of their leitmotifs to make the game more rich!
7900 USD [REACHED!!!]
If this goal is met I will add a romantic route for the nightmare agent, Opal to the Deluxe version of the game. The money will go toward additional art, writing, and voiced lines for Opal! 

 9100 USD [REACHED!!!]
In order to reduce the cost of the game, I prioritized the fantastical magical background art of Chalcedonia and related areas. If this goal is met, I'll be able to commission more original background art!

 10,000 USD [REACHED!!!]
Right now the fairies share a joint friendship route, but if this goal is met, I'll add in separate romance route in the DX version for Valerie's fairy partner, Diana! The money will go toward additional writing, art, and voiced lines for Diana! Opal's route will also become free-to-play if this goal is reached!

My name is Xeregha Lopez, most of you know me as Arthur, PastelPyon, or Pyonkotchi, the creator of Magical Warrior Diamond Heart. I am the main writer for the game, the lead artist, character designer, and I also made the logo and GUI. I'm a full-time college student and a freelance artist, as you can imagine that makes me quite a bit busy! Despite this I'm pretty much hopelessly devoted to this project <3 You can find me on Twitter and Tumblr, and email me at XereghaL@gmail.com for general inquiries and DiamondHeartVN@gmail.com for MWDH related questions!

I came up with the concept in 2014, back then it was a smaller scale project meant to be a NaNoRenO game, but it has grown far beyond my imagination since then <3 I have dabbled in Ren'Py before but this will be my first full fledged release (Liam goes to snurch doesn't count!). 

I have been working on the game alone for the past few years, but now there are many talented people who help and support me make the game become much more magical than it ever was before! 
Some of the people who help with the project are:

Diamond - Co-Writer, Idea bouncer
RenaHeart - Art Assistant
Mochiskii - Art Assistant
Raka - Background Artist
Tea Marie - Music
TellerFarsight - Programming
And the incredibly talented cast of voice actors <3"
57,57,"Hello,
I'm Lucretia, (Lulu for short); a New York based artist with a focus on surrealism presented through the lens of women's mental health. You can see my work HERE. 
In the past I have mainly focused on print work and individual pin creation to moderate success, and as such I have decided to expand my repertoire with a new series of pins that I have entitled the ""Strange Objects"" series. 
Human beings, often unconsciously, tend to see faces in objects. In these moments of anthropomorphic pareidolia we project features, emotions and scenarios onto inanimate objects. The ""Strange Objects"" series was born of this idea: a wilting flower filled with misery, a melting candle all too aware of its own mortality, the lamp at your bedside which watches you toss and turn in your sleep. Common items made uncomfortably human in their characteristics. 
As this is a niche series, I have decided to bring the project to Kickstarter for sake of funding. I am hoping these pins will delight others who view the world a little differently, the casual fans of the cute and the disconcerting, and any and all who might just enjoy the idea of a chair with human legs.
Because Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform, these pins will not be made if the campaign is unsuccessful. Such is the nature of things, as it would be cruel to birth something unwanted into this strange world. They may in theory find life in a later time, but they would cost more than the amounts presented here. The initial goal for this project is to accrue $300 USD to fund an initial run of pins with additional pins being unlocked should further funding become available. Backers will have the opportunity to choose whatever Strange Object pin they would like, and should you find the items make you uncomfortable you can of course change or cancel your pledge any time during the campaign.



 * The single pin backer option DOES NOT apply to the chandelier. It has it's own option in the rewards because this one is 3x as expensive to make. 
If you have pledged and would like to add a chandelier, add $20 to your existing pledge.
Thank you for understanding."
58,58,"This is the next generation, spiritual successor to the classic retro game, Mutant League Football
The secondary is blowing up these receivers today!
Mutant Football League is an NFL Blitz arcade-style football game, with nasty mutants, ferocious monsters, deadly chainsaws, and lots of gory player deaths, along with some edgy, satirical humor that parodies America's favorite sport.
The game is near alpha and fully playable now. We’re planning to release it on the PC in 2017 and then XBox One and PS4 in early 2018.
Give MFL a test drive so you can see exactly where the game is in development. There are some bugs and game rules which are not working correctly (but you will still have fun playing). The User can play a single game against the computer or local multiplayer game against friends (2 to 4 players). Since the game is pre-alpha and not fully tested you may experience some issues based on different PC Configurations. We apologize in advance for any frustration.
 You will need an Official Xbox One or PS4 DualShock Controller to play the game on PC. Keyboard and Mouse are not supported yet.  
PC Requirements
Windows 7 or higher  
Intel Core i3 or better  
nVidia gForce 460 or better (with 1.5+ GB of memory)
4 GB RAM or more
It's not cheating when it's The MFL-approved & officially licensed chainsaw.
Mutant Football League is an action football game where you pick from 14 Unique Teams or 3 All-Star Teams for online or offline gameplay, in solo, co-op, or head-to-head modes. Players can win by scoring more points than the opposition or by literally decimating the opposing team so they have to forfeit. The choice is yours! This is the next generation, spiritual successor to the classic retro game, Mutant League Football with beautiful 3D graphics and impressive gore effects.
Genre:      Sports / Action
Players:   1 to 4 players
Length:     High Replay-ability
Release:   Oct 2017
Languages: English (will add additional languages if there is demand).
Hey, at least he got the First Down!
Online and offline multiplayer for 2 to 4 players - competitive and co-op - so you can laugh at your friends while you crush them under your cleats.
Over the top visual and gore effects include blood splatters, comically horrific deaths, fire effects, exploding body parts, and dismemberment.
Extremely dangerous fields are filled with diabolical traps and hazards – including explosive mines, toxic moats, lava flows and crazed fans cheering on their favorite squad of murderers.
Each team has its own set of twisted audibles such as the classic ""Bribe the Ref"" where you payoff the referee to look the other way, or new additions like ""Chainsaw Massacre"" where your runningback pulls out a league-approved chainsaw and slices and dices the defense into submission, and ""Ginormous” where your blitzer grows 5-times his normal size - have fun trying to block him!
These are your game breaking, wisecracking mutants who have special skills, abilities, weapons; They're players who can single-handedly win you the game. So you’ll need to protect them because nothing hurts worse than losing your favorite all-star to a chainsaw or giant Orc.
DeadHeads are an undead skeleton species who are balanced in all skill rating categories which makes them solid MFL players at almost all positions. Extremely dangerous, skeletons are not afraid of taking a heavy hit because they’re already dead! Being undead also allows skeletons to heal faster than any other character species.
When they were first introduced to the League, most were skeptical about these metallic monstrosities. As technology advanced, corporate teams started acquiring more Robots than any other species.  These updated robots have massive armor and come in different sizes. Some are built for speed, while others are built to withstand large amounts of damage.
Orcs are big, brawny and breath-takingly dumb. Trolls are the most brutal species in the game (meaning they like to kill). What they lack in speed they more than make up for in brute strength, they can be punishing players that inflict heavy damage on opposing players.  With their strength and size, they are perfectly suited be linemen (blockers and blitzers).
More species to be announced soon!
With our initial goal demolished, it’s now overtime for Mutant Football League. This is your chance to expand the game to include new combatants, more bloody thirsty action, and of course a lot more menacing ways to include much more mayhem. Take a look at our Stretch Goals, top up your pledge, and get in while the blood is warm!
In 1993, EA released a monsters-and-mutant sports game called “Mutant Football League,” which became popular amongst gamers and critically celebrated press. Since then, gamers have grown to expect more in terms of characters, environments, animations and gameplay, welcome to the all new, Mutant Football League.
A new beginning ...    
Mutant Football League is a completely new and totally original take on the monster mash-up sports genre, and comes loaded with attitude and comic violence on the playing field. The overall presentation of MFL has been re-visualized from it’s predecessors, but the same sense of urgency that’s an inherent part of a real-world football characterizes our game play. In short, the pacing of our MFL game is on steroids! 
And you thought orcs were big before…
Thanks to fan suggestions and community prodding, we’ve amped up MFL’s humorous moments that can range anywhere from silly, and raunchy to politically incorrect, which our MFL characters have no problem expressing thanks to their over-the-top personal attributes and individual attitudes. You won’t be disappointed with the characters, animations, and overall spirit of our game - unless you’re one of THOSE people.

Mutant Football League is a great gruesome, diabolically sinister game of maniacal proportions, but we need your help to finish it.  While there are a few spots that need some more polish, the primary goal of our campaign is to allow us to complete Online Multiplayer mode and then fine tune the rest. 
There are many aspects to the game that we can lovingly improve but we have limited time and resources, so we need to know what is most important to you. We need your feedback and guidance on team balance, play modes, controls, humor, plays & formations, audio, player names, etc. Everyone who purchases the game will be involved in our Beta program.

You’ll be able to play the game and then provide feedback to us, let us know what’s working and what isn’t so we can get every ounce of bloody fun possible. If we’re lucky enough to hit our funding goal, you can help us decide what STRETCH GOALS we should consider too.
We are a small and dedicated team who believe in this project. Since its inception, MFL has been self-funded by the founders of Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC. All money raised for this Kickstarter campaign will go directly toward game production minus reward fees (estimated at 25%).

59,59,"Iris Divine has found its groove.  Our critically praised Karma Sown set the template with accolades including MetalReviews.com Surprise Of The Month, DPRP.net Album Of The Week and 9.5/10, Sea Of Tranquility 4.5/5, Hard Rock Haven 9/10, NovaMetalReview 10/10, described as ""perfection in fifty minutes"" by Background Magazine, and several 'album of the year' mentions, to name a few.
And now, THE STATIC AND THE NOISE promises to crank up the raw energy and continue the progression.  
Metal fans can rest assured knowing that the drop-tuned heavy guitars and gut-level grooves are intact.  Elements of alternative/ indie rock, industrial and pop add new dimensions to our progressive metal foundation on this record, and every killer riff and hook is balanced by our trademark rhythmic shifts and sense of atmosphere.  
The lyrics dig deeper, and the emotions are intense.  Building on our core lyrical themes of conflict and redemption, we take on political violence, personal empowerment, self deception, painful personal relationships, and other complex manifestations of the human condition.  
The album is 'progressive' not only in the sense of genre, but because we are truly progressing and developing our sound.  Our conceptual inspirations this time around include White Pony, Angel Dust, and other records that take a band's signature sound and add twists to challenge their fans, creating a new statement in the process.  
You can expect the same professional quality production that we achieved on Karma Sown - we are working with Drew Mazurek, Kevin Gutierrez and Brian J. Anthony to deliver a powerful, organic and big sound.  
We've been through some interesting 'firsts' since the release of Karma Sown, including our first experiences with management, a label, and proper PR, as well as a mid-Atlantic/ East Coast mini-tour...  
Which brings us now to THE STATIC AND THE NOISE.  The record will be fully funded by us (and hopefully you!), and we are counting on you to help us make this journey into the next phase of our musical career.
BUDGET:
Recording a great-sounding album, up to our standards, requires significant resources. Interestingly, when a band wants to retain a somewhat organic sound, as we do, it is actually more costly in some ways. Capturing real guitars, played through real amps, and real drums, require real studios and engineers!
When all is said and done, the total budget for the album, inclusive of recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, merchandise, pressing and related costs, will likely fall somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.  
The Kickstarter goal we have set is extremely modest, considering this, and we have already invested thousands into starting the record.  We hope to meet and exceed our goal, so that this band can complete the record while remaining sustainable and able to move forward.
REWARDS: 
In additional to the standard and popular T-shirts, CDs etc., we have chosen to highlight our approaches to our respective instruments, and various glimpses into the songwriting process that gives Iris Divine its sound.  For all you musicians out there, this is an awesome way to connect and 'talk shop'!!  And, if you wanna create a combo of rewards that pull from different tiers, pitch it to us and we'll try to make it happen! "
60,60,"Hello! We are Mumblecrust Theatre - an Award-Winning Theatre Company from Somerset in the UK. We are raising funds for our brand new production: an adaptation of HG Wells' Sci-Fi Masterpiece The Time Machine!
“Mumblecrust Theatre stand out with their polish and charm” --- Voice Magazine
  • The Show
A Victorian scientist perfects his invention, the world’s first Time Machine! It launches him 800,000 years into the future where he discovers a race of cute creatures the size of teddy bears, frolicking in a dreamlike paradise. Everything is perfect! Or so it seems… In the shadows, eyes watch and creeping feet disturb his sleep. In the future, monsters are very real indeed...
The Time Machine is an absolute classic by HG Wells, the father of modern sci-fi, and it’s crying out for adaptation for stage! We will use the theatrical power of storytelling, puppetry and music in an hour-long family show, with a cast of two. We will design and make a cast of over 20 puppets, including the fluffy, adorable Eloi and the slimy, subterranean Morlocks! We will compose original songs and sound design to immerse audiences in Wells’ world. A cinematic score, composed using top-of-the-line orchestral software, will create a suitably epic backdrop to the story. Something quite unique in touring theatre.
This will be a mobile, touring show, designed to visit mid-scale theatres, arts centres and community halls. Like our last show, our set-design will be striking but simple - packing a visual punch but easy to put up and take down.
And of course, what of the crazy contraption itself, the time machine? Wells’ depiction of time travel is way ahead of its time, so we need to do justice to what, in many ways, is the central character of this story. It’s going to be a beautiful, enormous, eccentric, crazy, Victoriana steampunk contraption, made of brass and cogs and whirring dials.
  • The Task Ahead
The two of us will design, make, write, compose and perform in the show. It may seem like a crazy undertaking, but we've done it once and we will do it again! Audiences love the fact we do so much of this ourselves, it draws them in and inspires them. This has cropped up again and again in our feedback.
“Beautifully designed set and puppets came to life thanks to these insanely talented performers/writers/musicians/puppeteers- they do it all!” --- (Audience Member about The Tale of the Cockatrice)

   • What Your Money Will Do
The money we raise from this campaign will go towards: 
Puppets! - clay for sculpting faces, fabrics and wood/plastics/metals for mechanisms 
Materials for making Props, Set and Costumes  
Any specialist Equipment or Tools required for the above!  
Orchestral Music Software - for the show's cinematic score  
Preliminary Publicity, including professional photos to send to venues

This Kickstarter will ensure that The Time Machine gets made, in one form or another! We will also be applying for additional arts funding. As many of us know, funding can be very competitive as so many amazing projects compete for limited funds. Not only will your support help us financially, it will also help us demonstrate to funding bodies that there is a true demand for our work, that people want to see this show made! This can make all the difference.
Initial Puppet Designs
• How You Can Help Us
Obviously, anything you can contribute to this Kickstarter, however small, will be a great help! If, however, you can't afford anything right now, don't worry! There's still a way to help...
Just share this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Reddit, blogs, websites - you name it! This helps us spread the word which is so important for crowdfunding.
Remember, we can only receive our funds if we reach our goal, so any and all support you can give (financial or otherwise!) will be invaluable to us. Thank you!!
  • Our Experience
Not only have we made one show together already, we've also collaborated on a number of other projects, including satirical music video Tawdry Child, Pinecone Penguin’s King Kong the Musical, puppeteering the Mermaid in Luc Mollinger’s creature feature short Battered and co-directing (and creating puppets for) new musical Heartwood.
Photos from some of our past collaborations
On top of that, we have combined experience and training in puppet making, composing, acting, costume design, social media marketing, sound design, producing, singing, puppeteering, set design and script-writing! We may be a tiny team, but we cover all the bases!
 • Our Supporters
For The Time Machine, we will have advice and mentoring from some amazing Arts Organisations in Somerset. This is fabulous, but it hasn’t always been the case! For our first production, The Tale of the Cockatrice, all we had was a very small Kickstarter campaign. Which goes to show, great things can come from humble beginnings!
After our premiere of Cockatrice in 2016 we teamed up with Niki McCretton at The Lyric Theatre, Bridport to develop the show further. We soon realised how vital outside input and support is, to enrich creativity.
The Time Machine is the first production to be part of Theatre Orchard & Living Spit's Artist Development Scheme ""Shoplifting"", and our rehearsals and premiere will be held at Theatre Shop, Clevedon. Living Spit are an amazing theatre company and their experience and know-how (particularly when it comes to two-hander touring theatre) is going to be invaluable! As well as this, we’re receiving amazing support from Take Art, who are hosting our scratch performance in front of local schools in our area! It’s reassuring to know a lot of talented people have our back as we continue to develop as a company, we feel so grateful."
61,61,"Our project lays home on a level part of a 100 acre plot of land home to one of the largest mapped cave systems in the country and we plan to take full advantage of that by using the cave's year around consistent temperature to use the cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter to heat/cool the greenhouse. This layout will drastically reduce the monthly operating costs, as well as making use of the underground water to provide for our aquaponic system.
Currently we have one greenhouse that has been unused for the better part of the last two decades. The greenhouse was pretty over grown with weeds, poison ivy, even some rose bushes and a lemon tree that had managed to survive all these years.
This is what it looked like when we started, Yikes!!
To give a little back story, the property has been in my childhood best friend/ partner's family since the 1970's. With over 22 mapped miles of cave, the property is home to two entrances into the system and sees a multitude of cavers year around, like surrounding boy scout troops and sees travels from as far up north as Michigan and Wisconsin with the majority of cavers from the Ohio area..
This magnitude of cavers and the hospitality of the late Tom and Cathy Crockett has led to an ongoing tradition of ""Caver's Thanksgiving"". This event takes place yearly the weekend following Thanksgiving.
The Progress -
The greenhouse sits beside the main entrance to the cave, which is also where the greenhouse shaft is connected that it gets it air supply from.
We have a mission to create a small aquaponic greenhouse farm to help provide our community with the best possible organic produce that is grown right here fresh and locally.
Break down of where the money is going to be used -
Appalachian Agriculture Dutch Bucket System - 30' x 72' - $3900
250 Gallon IBC Tanks - 150$ each 5 needed - $750
Pumps/Fittings/Pipes to complete Aquaponic tanks - $1,100

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      Total - 5,750
We were fortunate enough that all the fans just needed a little grease to be up and running again. We have tried to include just the bare minimum to get our project off the ground.  Our funding goal is geared toward obtaining enough capital to get our dutch bucket system for our Tomato's and the necessary tanks/fittings/pumps to connect it.
Thank you for taking the time to look at our Kickstarter and we hope to be delivering fresh organic tomato's and other produce to you and our local community very soon!"
62,62,"Interior of 1st tote made of plant-based vegan leather
Sure, there are thousands of handbag and accessory companies out there. But how many of them can you make a purchase from and actually feel good about it? Rogan & Ruff is being formed to allow you to do just that. Did you know, second only to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world!? In addition to not exploiting animals for fashion, Rogan & Ruff uses all ALL of their responsibly-sourced materials. When we make a handbag, the extra pieces of material become dog collars, leashes, reusable straw pouches and more! So what sort of plant-based materials are we using? Glad you asked!! 

One of our product materials is a brand new, eco-friendly and innovative material called pinatex! This material is made from the husks/leaves of pineapples and made into a non-woven material by the pineapple farmers. How cool is that?! What is even cooler is that this material is durable like leather, but lighter weight and MUCH better for the environment. Very very few U.S. based companies are using this incredible resource and we think that's a shame! Rogan & Ruff wants to use as much of it as possible :) 

We carry the value of our brand throughout everything we do. From being paperless and online, to reduce our carbon footprint, to designing and manufacturing bags in a clean and ethical USA textile factory, purchasing a bag or accessory from Rogan & Ruff, means making a positive impact in the world. 
Currently, Rogan & Ruff has completed branding and a 2-year company plan. The next step relies on you! In order to move to production of the products, we need what are called Tech Packs. These are technical, computer renditions of the bags (and other goods) that allow for the manufacturing process to take place. This, plus the other start-up costs associated with building a company, is what your pledge goes to!!

Rogan & Ruff was inspired by Donna's love of both handbags and animals. Having rescue dogs and cats herself, the line between friend and fashion became increasingly clear, and she knew she had to do something about it. So, with the loss of her corporate job, it was clearly time to pursue the dream: Change the world through fashion, and make sure an animal's place remains by our sides and never on them. 
So began the design of the bag nobody is dying for.
Literally. 
Current project status: 
Our debut line will feature a tote with multiple interior pockets, including a slot for an iPad/tablet, phone holder, key holder, and water bottle pocket, and more! The excess material from creating that tote will be made into matching dog collars and reusable straw pouches! We are all about not being wasteful, being stylish, and practical. 
Our next step is our ""tech pack"" with our manufacturer. The tech pack is the pattern they use to assemble the pieces. It only needs to be done once but is expensive to do, and we don't want to make our bag prices too high that not everyone can afford them. That's where you come in! If everyone donates, even a small amount, the patterns will be forever ours and able to be reused again and again, creating a fair price for the accessories. 
Once the tech packs are funded and created, we move right into manufacturing! Donna has sources beautiful, sustainable materials that will make these products not only stylish and durable, but eco and animal-friendly!

63,63,"    Touching Them, Touching Me - A Love Song for the Dead C is the first in a series of multimedia installation and performance works in which Helga Fassonaki situates herself in the position of a Hagiographer, visually depicting the lives of her musical heroes (deemed saints) - their culture and world that she has incorporated into her own (as fan, artist and musician).  By applying their concepts to her works, she explores her relationship to them and their music via a lens of their own creation. In painting them in an unfailingly positive light, this hagiographic portrayal also touches on bigger ideas of idol worship, the nature of fandom, and sub-cultural mythology - all of which can lead to misguided glorification. But this is a glorification that also leads to a pulsating energy from within, and an urge to destroy in order to create anew.    
     Fassonaki will be exhibiting the first work in the series at Human Resources Gallery in Chinatown, LA and will be needing funds to (A) transform the gallery space into a simulacrum of post-punk 1980’s Dunedin, New Zealand - more specifically, the Empire Tavern, a pub where the Dead C played their early shows and (B) to produce a vinyl record by yek koo (her solo music project) consisting of 5 composed pieces influenced by the Dead C and that explore aspects of their approach.   In conjunction to the exhibition will be a three day performance series called 'Trapdoor Fucking Exit' named after one of the Dead C's most phenomenal albums and featuring artists from the US and New Zealand who have been influenced or inspired by the Dead C.  The performance dates are April 20 - 22 and will take place inside the Empire installation. 
SHOW AT HUMAN RESOURCES GALLERY:
March 24th - April 22, 2012
Opening Reception: Saturday March 24, 2012
3-Day Performance Series: April 20 - 22, 2012
For more information about the gallery check out the Human Resources Website at: http://humanresourcesla.com/
SUPPORT:
All financial support goes directly to helping cover building and production costs:
Mastering, plating, and pressing costs for 'Love Song for the Dead C' Album (300 copies)
Printing costs for 'Love Song for the Dead C' LP - (300 copies)
Building materials (to make the Pub installation)
Installation and labor costs
THANK YOU:
So many people have reached out to help me with this project whether in terms of time, advice, talent, technical expertise, love, support, and/or home-cooked meals.  Thank you for being part of my life - I am so grateful for your generous support of my project. 
ABOUT THE ARTIST:

    Floating between worlds of experimental sound and visual art, Helga Fassonaki approaches each of these worlds with insights gained from the other. Her practice, including her music-performance projects, Metal Rouge and Yek koo, are informed by New York No Wave musicians and their defying of categorization, audience, and convention; the poetic, political and physical chants of Patti Smith; and the raw and damaged sounds of New Zealand’s free noise music of the Le Jazz Non era for stretching the parameters of improvised music.  Informed by such artists and their integration of art and music, she has created sound and art installations, group situations, films, and performances that utilize and question temporality, power structures, subcultures, fan cultures, and the human voice as a crucible for positive transformation.
    Fassonaki's work has been exhibited at UCLA's New Wright Gallery, Elysian Park Museum of Art, and LACE galleries (Los Angeles), Blue Oyster Gallery (Dunedin, NZ), Elam School of Fine Art (Auckland, NZ), Orange County Museum of Art (CA), and California College of the Arts (San Francisco), among others. She has performed in Open Melody Festival at UC Irvine (CA), Ear&Eye Festival (Auckland, NZ) alongside legendary sound artists Akio Suzuki and Phil Dadson, On Land Festival (San Francisco), Human Resources (LA), Public Fiction (LA), and a multitude of other galleries and venues throughout the country. She is also the cofounder of a record label called Emerald Cocoon, which focuses on experimental, psychedelic, and avant-garde music.

""I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How it got in my pajamas I'll never know.” ― Groucho Marx
        Stand-Up Neurotica´s unique concept relies on both the chemistry and relationships between the characters, and on the novelty of different comedians starring in each episode. The show is currently written as an ""Adult Comedy"" to be aired on a cable network (HBO, SHO, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.) The show features cursing, vile humor, freedom for each comedian's act and, of course, the occasional hot ""sexual content."" This show will blow your neurotic mind!
               Actors chosen will contribute to the show, the final version, the comic timing, through rehearsal and improvisation.The show will be filmed in classic sitcom style, in front of a live audience to create the energy that only a live performance can bring. The idea is to film the pilot in a small theater  with several ""performances"". The best parts of the each performance can be edited together to make an excellent pilot episode.
        Now, with a show with this much potential, we need a pilot that oozes with professionalism. From what I have researched, $50,000 is a good goal number. With this amount (or more) a true performance can be put on, a comic can be paid, and a wonderful pilot can be produced.
Estimate of Budget Breakdown
Premise                
The plots and subplots revolve around the central characters, the employees of a comedy club. The six of them have become close friends. Other characters may include the club's audience members, family members and passing relationships. A comedian would ‘guest star’ each episode and get a five to seven-minute time slot during which they perform their act. However, no matter how famous the comedian, on the show, he or she is depicted as an up-and-coming performer. 
 Setting                
Club Neurotica is a small, average-looking comedy club in the West Village of New York City. An outside similar to surrounding clubs: walls with peeling posters of adverts, a display case showcasing the upcoming performance, well-worn windows and doors, on a busy city corner. Inside, there is a long bar along one wall, a stage across the room, and about 20 tables scattered around the room. The décor is understated -- posters, candles on tables, a beat-up wood floor and a tin ceiling. 
 Characters: 
  Seth Stevenson: (34)  The manager of the club. He is decent-looking, not model-like. He enjoys his work and chasing women. Seth always seems to be nervous, as though he has forgotten something. He hopes to find the love he once shared with his ex-wife, Julia, for whom he still has feelings. He was devastated when Julia left him after she had an affair with a woman. Their break-up is fresh, under a year, yet they are healed enough to lust after others.
               They try to remain friends and control urges. Seth is getting used to checking out the same women and sharing comments, but he is still getting over his hurt and thinks he will never get over loving her. He has never actually seen Julia with another woman; that is, until the pilot episode, when he sees a lot more than he ever expected to. 

  Julia O'Malley : (32)- Owner of the club and Seth’s ex-wife. Her beauty is a very natural one. Raised in Manhattan, she attended tony prep schools.  She is used to getting what she wants, and likes the finer things in life – upscale mani-pedis, up-to-the-minute fashions, and whatever the New York Styles section touts as “in”. Julia follows the latest in pricy wellness fads—she is currently in the midst of another $350 juice cleanse and recommends it to everyone.   
     Julia’s parents purchased the club when Julia married Seth, who had already been managing the place for eight years. This, Julia thought, would bring them closer together, but it has created and continues to cause friction between them. She knows little about the business of the club but she insists on being involved. 
 Nella Petrini – (48) Nella is short and voluptuous. She is an Italian firecracker; loud, crass, vulgar and honest to a fault. Her look and attitude are evocative of a “mafia wife.” Nobody messes with Nella. She is also intelligent and flirtatious (with special attention to Jaime).
     Later, we come to find out that Nella is married, has a son and older daughter, but she is very guarded about her private life and offers few details. She jokes about the ""wise guys"" from the Arthur Avenue section of the Bronx. (i.e. ""That guy should watch it or he'll end up in a fucking freezer. Of course, we'd need a huge freezer for that fat fuck."",  etc.) However, none of her comments make any reference to actual family and friends, so we are left to wonder.
Cheryl Sonders- (36) A waitress who is beautiful in a slapdash way. She is perpetually in need of a haircut or a new pair of shoes. While she turns heads, many men are turned off by her intelligence and brash feminist views. She graduated with top honors from Fordham University with dreams of becoming a trial attorney; she has a real desire to help women in need.                
     Additionally, she had dreams of having a family, dreams she thought were coming true when she married her college sweetheart. She put off going to law school and had two children with him. But her marriage fell apart due to his drug addiction and his enabling parents. Now she is a single mother with mountains of debt.  She is attending law school (CUNY) part-time during the day. Her concentration is in family law, for which she now has a lot of personal experience.
David Semple- (41) A waiter who feels he is the great representative of the modern gay male population. He is good-looking in an awkward sort of way. David is unfazed by homophobia and unashamed of his sexuality. He has been pursuing a dream of doing musical theater and cabaret-type shows. His singing voice sends chills down one’s spine. He seems a bit arrogant, pessimistic, conceited, selfish, a bit of a hypochondriac, yet quite affectionate                This loving side is revealed in the way he cares for his grandmother. He is the only family member who is in his grandmother’s life and he makes it his business to make her life as comfortable as possible, no matter how much of a pain she is. He also is deeply interested in finding a partner to spend his life with.

Jamie Velez- (30) The bartender, Jaime (pronounced HI-me) is an Hispanic man with model-looks -- a dark complexion, high cheekbones and a lanky, well-muscled build . He is warm and friendly, easy to chat with. Cheryl and he are the best of friends, but Jamie wishes it would develop into more. In fact, he is “head over heels” for her, and when she is near, he finds it difficult to maintain his usual ‘cool’ demeanor. This leads to occasional ""physical comedy"" like that of Charlie Chaplin.
Jamie was born in the Dominican Republic. His mother struggled as a single mother after moving to the United States when he was nine. Jaime has a ten year-old daughter whom he adores and spends as much time with as his job will allow. His devotion to her and commitment to supporting her (he is a bit of a workaholic) make the prospect of a social life difficult. Jaime is also a an avid cartoonist (he adores Marvel comics and manga) and has hopes of one day making his living that way. 

  Muriel Stevenson- (80‘s) David’s grandmother, she is a quintessential Jewish grandmother.  She is always harping on him to better his life, settle down with a “nice girl” (she never accepted David’s sexual orientation), and she stops by regularly to give David his dose of guilt.
Eric Todd- (18) Bar-back, running joke is that he never speaks. He always in the bar reacting to the action, moving glasses, getting beer, cleaning, etc.
Vagrant- (60’s) A man with wild eyes and messy long hair who wears mismatched clothing. He has a raspy voice from too many cigarettes. He also holds an ‘old school’ boom box on his shoulder blaring out classic disco.
Molly- (35) A striking audience member who becomes the object of both Seth’s and Julia’s lust.
Audience members- This show will be best filmed in front of a live audience. Hence, audience members would have a chance to “win a lottery” that would allow them perform as extras during the show.
                                        ""He's Late"" (Pilot)
               The pilot introduces the main characters and places the audience is smack-dab into the middle of a busy night at the comedy club where we find Seth freaking out because a comedian is late. Also:
Seth and Julia fall in lust with Molly, a female customer.

Nella nearly gets into a fistfight with some guy over a parking spot.
David deals with his eccentric grandmother who is still trying to find him a ""nice Jewish girl""
A crazy homeless man comes in the bar.
Cheryl is driving her best friend Jaime crazy with love and
A comedian puts on a show.
And Seth opens the coat closet door to find Julia and Molly nude and on the verge of orgasm.

   Whew!
This ""kickstarter"" for the sitcom pilot Stand-Up Neurotica is the culmination of a dream I have had for many years. I came up with this concept almost 20 years ago and now I am hoping for ""crowd funding"" which, for those of you who don't know, is a way for lots of people to sponsor a big idea and help it come to fruition. So I am hoping YOU, or maybe people you know, may want to be a part of this. Even a few dollars counts! You will NOT get charged unless I reach my goal of $50,000 in 30 days. But NOW is a crucial time. Most projects that succeed get many sponsors within the first week! Then others are more apt to follow. I know I am dreaming big here... But I really think this could be an incredible show!!!
I am hoping that you have enjoyed this introduction to ""Stand-UpNeurotica"" and that you support the making of this pilot. 
Someday is now...
                   THIS IS NOT A DREAM FOR SOMEDAY...  
                                THIS WILL HAPPEN
                                    THIS SUMMER!

Finally, a vibration isolator designed to handle large gimbal systems like the Ronin or MōVI. Take your shots to the next level with smooth tracking movement from any vehicle. 
With the recent appearance of handheld stabilized camera gimbals, the creative movements possible are vast. Attaching these new pieces of technology on vehicles and aircraft opens the door for amazing camera motion control capabilities for prices lower than ever before. However, mounting these devices has proven difficult because of vibrations caused by tires, engines, rotor blades, or any other moving part on vehicles. Jerky movements of the vehicle can also put huge amounts of stress on the gimbals bearings and motors. The Cinema Isolator addresses this problem by utilizing strategically configured wire rope to support the gimbal and allow it to absorb inertial movements. It may seem like wire rope is too stiff for this application, but in reality it offers the perfect amount of compression with a delayed rebound. This is cause by friction between the small metal strands that make up a cable. Below you can see this principle in action on our POV Vibration Isolator. Notice how the lower camera platform stays stationary while the upper platform is experiencing violent vibration. 
Applications
The Cinema Vibration Isolator can be used on practically any vehicle (or just about any moving object) with a grip rigging system in place. The discs are essentially 3/8"" cheese plates. It can also be bolted or strapped to just about anything for use without a rigging system. For easy automotive shots, a roof rack on any car is a great mounting location. Also, dynamic low camera angle shots can be produced by mounting the Cinema Isolator to large R/C vehicles. 
Mounted using standard 3/8"" grip equipment and suction cups
Its wide absorption range allows it to remove high frequency vibrations, while dampening low frequency oscillations. High frequency vibrations can be caused by motors, rotor blades, propellers, and anything that has fast moving parts. These can typically cause rolling shutter or 'jello' issues in the video. Lower frequency vibrations can be cause by a vehicle driving off road, or quick changes in direction. These movements can cause gimbal motors to 'slip' and throw off the stabilization. Also, if the camera is hard-mounted to the vehicle, any jerky moment will create huge amounts of stress on the gimbals bearings which causes permanent damage. The Cinema Isolator allows the gimbal to shift around and therefore reduce stress. 
Compatible Gimbal/Camera Combinations
The Cinema Vibration Isolator can be customized to hold multiple payloads ranging in weight from a MōVI M5 with a BMPCC, all the way up to a Ronin with a RED Dragon and cinema lenses. This is achieved by using different sizes of cable, and removing cable modules. Customers will be able to specify their needs before purchasing. 
Wire modules can be removed for lighter camera systems

Materials: CNC aluminum, Stainless steel, and G10 fiberboard             
Mounting Options: 3/8"" cheese plate. Holes every 1""                        
Gimbal attachment: The top disc has hole patterns to match the MōVI and Ronin. Other gimbals can be attached by drilling custom holes. 
The Cinema Isolator is perfect for gimbals in the 4 - 13kg (8-28lb) range.
Multiple sizes of wire can be used to increase or decrease stiffness and payload capacity. 
Why we need your help                                                                               
Our first prototype Cinema Isolators used 4 small plates to sandwich the wire rope and hold it steady in the proper configuration. 
This method is cheap and easy to manufacture but adds hours to the build process. Threading the stiff wire through the bolts and plates is EXTREMELY tedious. We have developed a new method that will be much easier, stronger, and less time consuming to build. It consists of aluminum brackets that use set screws to grip the cable ends. The down side is that these brackets require CNC milling, which is expensive to start due to tooling fees. The funds raised in this campaign will be used to help pay for the tooling costs and other manufacturing fees. Once this is accomplished, we will be able to produce large quantities of the product and offer it to our customers at an affordable price. 
This prototype uses bolts to hold the wire in place
Manufacturing Timeline:
Begin production - March 1st 2015
Start building Cinema Isolators - April 1st 2015
Ship first batch to our Kickstarter supporters - April 20th 2015
Once funding goal is reached, the Cinema Isolator will be able to be purchased here: Stratus Productions Store

68,68,"The Story Behind the Story
This story has been swirling around inside of me for the better part of two decades. I remember being in high school, sitting in my bedroom with my best friend, quietly writing in a notebook while he worked on a project of his own. I read the scene I had written aloud to him. He wanted more of the story. I thought about the characters all the time. I drew maps and created the alphabet of a created language. I worked at a grocery store, and on slow nights, I would print out blank sheets of the receipt tape, and scribble down ideas and conversations between characters in between transactions. I still have that old notebook and all those receipt papers. Through my determination not to let it die, and because of the many friends who continued to ask me about the book, I’m here at the threshold of a lifelong goal: to become a published author.
The World Between
Jamir of Lur-lataer, Priest of The Almighty, is living with a curse. He’ll follow wherever his god directs him to go, but how can he trust in a plan that hasn’t been revealed?
Marina, displaced in time, finds herself confronting a truth she never wanted to learn: she isn’t who she thinks she is.
Jakar of House Arcanan jumped through a portal into the unknown after the woman he has always loved. He won’t leave her, because the future depends on them being together.
Velundovil peels back the layers of time to see everything that has been, and everything that will be. She watches, wishing that there had been another way.
The World Between takes place in a fictional world similar to ours. There are kingdoms with wealthy nobles, cities with sea merchants and towns with humble citizens. There are forests, rivers, mountains and plains. Animal and plant life is like what we would find on Earth and species are named accordingly. This world is a place of magic, though there is disagreement about where it comes from and who can use it. One unique difference is that the world has two suns, one large and one small. Though this is a fantasy novel, absent from the world are other humanoid races such as elves, dwarves, halflings etc. Because the people are not of Earth, their cultures and languages do not exactly mirror those we would find in our world. Groups are more egalitarian in general and there are not many differences between gender roles. The world also has its own pantheon of gods and goddess with religious orders for each.
In writing The World Between, I have tried to incorporate many questions about what it means to be human. My hope is that readers will connect with the key questions that the characters ask themselves throughout the novel: Can I trust in something I can’t see? Is there a calling on my life? Can something good come from something terrible?
Stretch Goals
There are couple of stretch goals for the project and I really hope we can meet both of them.

72,72,"A motivational television talk show with a purpose.  There seems to be a movement at awards shows where celebrities tell their life stories very quickly and remind people to never listen to the Naysayers and to never, ever give up on your dreams, my show will tap into this sentiment but much deeper. I will interview successful people from all walks of life to learn how they overcame their individual failures and survived their darkest days and learn the tools they used to hold on and to continue through their struggles until they made it big. All for one reason, so that WE the audience can learn from their life lessons and apply some of them to our own lives, because we all hurt in some way.  No one's life is perfect and in talking with these celebrities, the audience will hear the grit and determination it takes to succeed when everyone around you is telling you that you can't. Some wonderful guests would be Rhonda Britten, Will Smith, Eminem, J.K. Rowling, Mike Tyson, Tony Robbins and so many other survivors.  All successful people have failed many times in their lives just like you and I and we will learn from their own words how they hung on during the lowest points of their careers and lives, what coping strategies they used, what tools and techniques they used to stay positive in the face of great adversity until they finally made it big.  My sincerest hope for this show is that someone who is watching will hear some gem of advice and ask for help and begin to heal whatever it is they are battling, because we all have our daily battles, sometimes we just need to be reminded to hold on and to keep fighting the good fight.  That's what Great Lives with Kevin Bungert will be, a daily reminder to hold on and to keep fighting, no matter what!  Thank You...Kev"
73,73,"Hello! This is Jazmin from Pics n Plans I am the artist behind the name, my partner is Chosani and I don't know what I would do without her running our Instagram/Facebook pages. We started bullet journaling together over a year ago and we have become obsessed.
https://www.instagram.com/picsnplans/
What is Bullet Journaling? Well, it all started for us at least, with a talented author by the name Ryder Caroll. They are super sweet and you can check out their page below for more info.
https://bulletjournal.com/
We love making customized journals, learning new concepts, and most of all we love sharing our love for journaling with the world. We have seen and met so many wonderful people, and have decided we wanted to start sharing some our creative ideas with everyone.
This Kickstarter is our first step into making our dreams a reality. We have worked super hard in between work, Chosani being a supermom, and a unbearable long commute.
We would love to have you join our Bullet Journal family!
This Kickstarter we are launching our first designs, Pudding the Panda! Our goal, have enough to fund 3 Vinyl waterproof stickers 3""x 3"". I have 2 more designs for stretch goals. If we meet all stretch goals we can upgrade to Holographic/Glitter stickers.
I only listed about 4 tiers to keep the prices reasonable. Of course if you offer more not only will you receive my eternal gratitude, but I may send an extra gift your way. 
Keep your money until we get funded. One cool thing about Kickstarter is that you will not be charged unless we hit goal. During the campaign you can increase or decrease your pledge amount. (But pledging to help us hit $500 enables us to aim for more designs)
Shipping will be sent via USPS first class mail.
If you only contribute a $1 you can still walk away with cool coloring pages to put in your journals/books/etc. (Please do not try to resell, as this would make me very sad.)

The sticker designs are below:
 (All images will be high resolution, I am keeping them low resolution with a watermark so peeps don't take them) 
$600 reached-Design 5 unlocks. Updated picture will be uploaded soon...
700 reached-Design 5 unlocks. Updated picture will be uploaded soon...
 If we reach $800 I can make the stickers holographic!!!
Now these stickers are all going to be 3""x 3"", although resizing may happen. (They will be bigger, since I want to keep the resolution looking nice)
Vinyl and waterproof.
Free thank you sticker surprise in each package. 
Digital download of coloring pages to put into your notebooks, gear, etc.
 September- Kickstarter launches
 October- Kickstarter campaign ends (Surveys are sent out)
 November/December- Stickers are produced and checked for quality
 January/February- Stickers are sent out!
This is an estimated timeline, and any issues with quality may cause a delay. I will be posting updates and keeping everyone in the loop for production.  
Now I understand that these are difficult times and everyone works hard for their money. So if you cannot contribute, I would ask that you share our kickstarter on social platforms. Links will be listed below, or you can share this very Kickstarter page. Please feel free to email me with any questions at picsnplans@gmail.com I will try my best to answer all questions in a speedy fashion.

Some information about my art career, I studied at the Art Institute and I am sad to say I never finished. I would love to complete that chapter someday. Hopefully this leads me in that direction. I have been seriously freelancing since over 10 years ago. I have designed many logos, tattoos, costumes, and much more. I have studied graphic design, typography, psychology, and Animation. I have also had the opportunity to showcase and sell my art at Katsucon, and Awesomecon. I'm always up for trying new things and taking both suggestions, and critiques.

74,74,"We at SpeakFreak have one simple goal: to bling out everything. We dream of a world where millions of little bits of nerdy art cover every surface. Children will push pins into each others' casts instead of writing on them. License plates will be replaced by pin boards. People will barely even be able to walk under the weight of metal and enamel.
And now, with our first-ever Kickstarter campaign, you can take a step into that world with us. Does your boss force you to wear a monkey suit and stamp out your individuality? Well, there's nothing unprofessional about a lapel pin! Disgusting sweater you have to wear so you're not the one who ruined Christmas? Pop a few pins in and you'll outshine the tree. Hole in your wall from rage or an escape attempt? No judgement here, just cover that bad boy up with a pin board! 
Pins
Each pin is made of hard enamel with gold plating, and comes packaged with a backing card and 8mm black rubber clutch. For each $200 raised, a new design will be unlocked. Each $10 reward tier earns you one pin of your choice from those available.

The REVAMPS Breakout Shield is a drop-in upgrade for 3D Printers who utilize a Ramps 1.4 controller board. Ramps 1.4 is an electronics hardware package that commands all the components of a 3D Printer. Our Shield interfaces with Ramps 1.4 and consolidates multiple inputs/outputs into fewer, simpler and more efficient wire management. When we first started designing a 3D Printer, we incorporated a viable electronics hardware package (Ramps 1.4) that was already a staple in the 3D Printing community.
Stock Ramps 1.4
The main focus was about creating a better 3D Printer than what was available. The electronics were initially overlooked in how they would merge with our initial prototypes simply because the mechanics were our main focus. Heck, we were just excited about 3D printing and not concerned about all the nuances. As designs evolved with Printing and wanting to create better hardware, we faced obstacles with the common 3D Printing hardware. We would be forced to choose other similar electrical packages or enhance what we had. The challenge with creating this additional  Breakout Shield for the Ramps 1.4 eventually enabled us to close the design process for our 3D Printer and hopefully you'll see what it can do for you!
Stock Ramps 1.4 wiring
The above image represents an attempt at trying to tidy up the wiring that almost seems inevitable when working with the stock Ramps 1.4 controller. All wires have to be traced back to the individual pins on Ramps 1.4 which are easy to bend/break, packed in a confined space and easily miswired when setting up a 3D Printer. Best described in the shop as ""Rat's Nest"". 
With our Shield, you are able to consolidate multiple inputs/outputs into fewer, higher quality cabling, eliminating the bulk of the wiring and transforming a 3D Printer into something more reliable, accessible and packed with possibilities.

77,77,"Three hundred years ago, a Bristol man called Edward Teach was the terror of the Caribbean. Better known as Blackbeard, he was the most notorious and successful pirate of his day. Teach’s criminal career came to a sticky end in 1718, but he was by no means the only Bristol sailor involved in piracy. The city also has a strong link to fictional pirates. Long John Silver from Treasure Island owned a pub in Bristol. In addition, literature’s most famous castaway, Robinson Crusoe, was based on Alexander Selkirk who came to Bristol after his rescue and there met Daniel Defoe. Woodes Rogers, the Bristol-based captain who rescued Selkirk, was a privateer who preyed on Spanish shipping. He later became Governor of the Bahamas and a scourge of pirates.
A few years ago Wizard’s Tower produced Airship Shape and Bristol Fashion, an anthology of steampunk stories set in and around Bristol, and written by local authors. It did very well, so I wanted to do something similar for the local writing community. When I began to think of a follow-up, pirates immediately came to mind. Everyone loves them, and there is a strong Bristol connection.
However, in thinking about the book it became obvious to me that it could not just be about Bristol. Our pirates didn’t ply their trade in the city; they did so far away across the sea. Most famously they did so in the Caribbean. Any book about pirates, therefore, should not just be about Bristol, but about the Caribbean too, and should involve people from the Caribbean.
Fortunately I happen to know quite a few excellent Caribbean writers of speculative fiction. Some of them have kindly agreed to write for this book. I’m hoping to work with them, and with my colleagues at Ujima Radio, to reach out to budding writers from the Caribbean, and to writers of Caribbean descent living in Bristol.
Although we do have some writers already signed up, the book will be open to submissions, assuming we achieve our funding goals.
Given the nature of speculative fiction writers, I am sure that people’s imaginations will rove far and wide. The book will contain stories about pirates, but some of them may ply their trade in the South China Sea, or in deep space, or with the help of a friendly dragon. All that we ask is that the stories should be about piracy, and that either the story or the writer should have some connection to Bristol and/or the Caribbean.
As for you readers, splice the mainbrace! Or have something non-alcoholic if you prefer. Then patch your eye, map your treasure and buckle on your parrot (dead or alive). It is time to take the Seven Seas, no matter where in space and time they might be found.

Stretch Goals
We have them. Here's the plan.
At £15,000 we'll add some essays about pirate history.
At £20,000 we'll produce hardcover editions of Piracity (and add extra reward levels so you can order them).
At £25,000 we'll pay our writers, editors and other contributors more."
78,78,"Tomorrow's Doctors are only going to be as good as how well educated they are today. 
In Medical school we are mainly left to fend for our self. We have books thrown at us with the expectation of knowing them inside out, without any real walk-through or explanation. Leaving most students to struggle, mundanely memorize and never really understand the actual medical importance of the practices that could save someones life. 
Yes is the answer to your question if you are asking yourself right now 'Is this happening to the doctor that might be trying to save my life one day'. 
I hope to create an online user interface where students in later years of education can provide help and tuition to their fellow medics in the years below. This will allow them a service where they can selectively choose how and by who they want to be educated by, giving them the freedom of being able to learn in the way they can best.  
In medicine experience is key, giving people the opportunity to be taught by someone who has went through the same hurdle not long ago is the most effective way to mold brilliant Doctors who can go on the use that knowledge to help and save people. 
For this project to become possible: I will need capital to set up the website and maintain it as well as to market the idea and increase the awareness of it amoung the student community. 
A crowd funding website is last place I expected myself to be But I know I can not do this alone. This is not just important for me or future Doctors, it is important for everyone because the education we invest in today will be the result we receive tomorrow. 

I believe this will make a difference. It will allow doctors to study with passion and not just pressure and who knows it might even save someones life; YOU might even save someones life.
I urge everyone to PLEASE help me make this dream possible. For a better future, for all of us. 
Thank you."
79,79,"Thank you for visiting my Kickstarter campaign to launch my book - The PS Vita: Year One. To summarise the premise, it’s an unofficial look back at the events of the Vita’s launch and its first year on the market and how those events defined the rest of its life.
Images and text not final.
About the book
The Vita struggled to make an impact on the game market but it found its audience of loyal fans (including myself) that continued to support it long after Sony stopped releasing games for the system. In this book, I take a look back at the launch of the Vita and its first year on the market. The Vita was labelled a “failure” just months after its launch. There were many reasons for this and I intend to explore the highs and lows of the Vita’s first year and how its performance and the negative reputation it obtained, continued to define the Vita for its life.
You can’t talk about the Vita’s launch without also discussing Nintendo’s 3DS and how a series of smart decisions from Nintendo (coupled with some bad decisions from Sony) sunk the Vita early on. The book will be broken up with retrospectives on some of the games that had the biggest impact (both positive and negative) on the system’s reputation.
The book will be A5 size and currently I’m targeting a length of 80-100 pages. It will include the history of the PS Vita and at least 10 game retrospectives. The following game retrospectives are currently planned:
Gravity Rush. 
Escape Plan 
Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified
Motorstorm RC
Uncharted Golden Abyss
Persona 4 Golden
LittleBigPlanet Vita
Sound Shapes
FIFA Football & FIFA 13
Need for Speed: Most Wanted. 
I will potentially add more depending on time and whether the kickstarter meets its stretch goals.

About me
My name is Sandeep Rai, also known as 2 Old 4 Gaming on Twitter and YouTube. I have been a gamer for most of my life. I have fond memories of sitting in front of the TV and playing my NES with my brother, but as an adult I’ve found handheld gaming just suited my life more. The PlayStation Vita, with its varied library of games and portability, has been my device of choice when it comes to gaming. Writing a book about the game’s industry is not something I have experience in doing, I’m more used to writing business reports in my day job! My passion for the Vita and its games inspired me to not only write this book but also to start my YouTube channel where I bring reviews and gameplay impressions of the latest PS Vita games.
Contributors
The book is being edited by Michael Rupprecht, Spencer Pressly and Adam Cartwright. Michael is the editor of Handheld Players. Michael brings a lot of experience in covering the Vita for years through his website and YouTube channel. He has owned a Vita since its launch and is a loyal fan of the handheld. Adam has his own site reviewing and commenting on Vita games (kresnik258gaming.wordpress.com) and is a guest writer on VGChartz and the Vita Lounge. Spencer has written for various sites in the past including Gaming Union. Now he mainly spends his time collecting for the Vita and creating a podcast called Shin Megami Tensei Network covering all things SMT/Persona.

Why Kickstarter?
As someone trying to launch an independent book, Kickstarter is a great way to drum up attention and also to gauge demand. I am also hoping that I could leverage a successful kickstarter for interview access with developers of some of the year 1 games.
Why Year 1?
I have been asked why not have the book cover the life to date of the Vita. There are a few reasons for focusing on the Vita's first year. Postage costs for international shipping are quite expensive. I am aiming to keep the weight of the book under 250g to avoid postage costs becoming ridiculously high. To try and fit the entire life of the Vita into a book of that size would be limiting. I would prefer to have the space to properly focus on this very important period in the Vita's life and be able to have detailed retrospectives on some of the big games from that first year. If the book turns out to be a success with a positive reception from the Vita community, I would like to consider making it a series of books focusing on each year of the Vita's life.

How will I use the funds?
I will be using all of the funds of a successful kickstarter to print the books. Assuming the project is fully funded, I will be able to have enough copies of the book printed to fulfil the orders of my kickstarter backers and to send copies to some games sites/YouTubers to help promote the book. After the kickstarter, the book will most likely only be sold digitally due to the printing costs for small runs making it not feasible to fulfil smaller orders.
When will the book be available? 
I am targeting completion of the book by the end of October 2018. It’s a conservative target and I’d hope to be done sooner but I just don’t want to over-promise and under-deliver.
Images and text not final.
Stretch Goals 
As someone working on this book independently, I am not able to promise a variety of physical rewards, instead my stretch goals will involve adding content to the book.
£2,000 - Additional game retrospective.
**NEW** £3,000 - Digital ""Director's Cut"" of the book for any one that has backed a reward tier that includes a digital version. It will include additional content (please see backer update for details).
£4,000 - Additional game retrospective.

80,80,"Hey everyone~
I'm back with a new style of designs to represent some of our feelings everyday when we deal with some unpleasant people in our lives...And since our parents taught us well enough not to say some of this sh*t out loud, I thought, why not create some elegantly rude designs that we can wear, decorate or carry around with us to represent feelings that we oh-so-polite people shouldn't say out loud? 
Are you sick of obnoxious people who think they're 100% perfect? Co-workers who don't bother reading your email carefully? Overly dramatic people? Or people who you're glad are now out of your life? I've got some elegantly rude designs for you!

81,81,"The Band:
Kill The Moment is a Norwegian Metal band established in 2010. KTM has four members with different background's but share a common passion. Our passion is simply the joy of playing music and be together as friends doing what we love the most. We play melodic guitar based music, with integrated elements like punch and groove. KTM is influenced by bands like: Trivium, In Flames, Lamb Of God, Judas Priest and Mastodon to name a few. What keeps us motivated is our starvation for musical perfection and the lust of sharing what we love to the people. KTM has won a competition for best live act during the event ""Nattrocken"" In 2011 And recently passed through to the finals of the: Metal To The Masses competition in Norway, which will be held 16 of may where the battle continues to get a live slot at the biggest English indi festival: Bloodstock. KTM consists of:
Eirik Ravn Waldeland - Bass
Willy Nordbø - Guitar/Vocal
Svein Olav Kaurin - Lead Guitar
Martin Hansen - Drums
See you on the road!
- Kill The Moment
The Album:
KTM have around 13 songs that could be considered for an album, now we need you to make our dream come true! Making an album has been the members of KTM wish for years and finally we feel that the time is right and musical material is sufficient. Now we want to share what has been giving us our musical satisfaction and motivation with you. First things first, lets put all the facts on the table: making an album is highly expensive, espessially for an unsigned band were all the funds have to come from your own pockets. some of us are students and some have only part time jobs. Still we dont want to contain what has been giving us all this joy, we want people listening to what KTM is all about, that is why we need your help. What KTM has put as our budget on kickstarter is infact not even half of what just recording and mixing costs, we still need mastering and burning our music to CD's and Vinyls. This however we will manage to pay ourselfs through hard work and time. What idea the album is based on and the meaning behind its theme will not however be revealed before its completed, its fun to spare some details and let the imagination flow. We hope that you will help us fund our album, hopefully it will be in your shelf by the end of the year!
The Plan:
Estimated price of recording/mixing the album is 7,500 $ Using an studio engineer/producer by the name of: Endre Kirkesola, who works at Dub Studio in Norway. He has worked with bands such as Chrome Division, Immortal, Blood Red Throne to name a few. We feel that this guy could help us make the album sound as it should be sounding, Heavy, in your face and melodic, capturing what is the sound of KTM. the plan is to start recording after the summer holidays and hopefully have the product finished by the end of the year. If we make our goal on kickstarter, we are in buisness to portray the new era of metal!
Our Gratitude:
We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for either reading about us or checking up on us. If you did not like the music/shows we would like to thank you for listening to it and giving us a chance. We hope that you have a great experience listening to our music or seeing us play a live show, just as much as we love doing it!
From all of us: thanks!"

83,83,"What is The Glebe Exhibit?
The Glebe Exhibit is a collection of artworks created by Mick, Matt, and Kathy Glebe: where every piece is authentic, iconic, and carefully created in great quality to take you on a journey of historic exploration and unique investment opportunities. The idea is simple: For the past decade we have illustrated amazing pieces of art leading up to this personal project. Over the years, we have had the pleasure of working on officially licensed properties for Marvel Entertainment, LucasFilm, DC Entertainment, and countless others. we are looking at expanding our creative works into our own original fine art collections, this would include having a brick and mortar gallery: The Glebe Exhibit. Through helpful funding of Kickstarter, we would host our own brick and mortar gallery, as well as maintaining it’s online counterpart at Twynsunz.com.  
The Glebe twins are a rare case of identical mirror twins (left and right handed artists).
Why invest in The Glebe Exhibit?
The first collection of artwork in this Kickstarter is themed around the Titanic—one of the most iconic shipwrecks in human history. We will be offering a unique opportunity to invest in not just our gallery and artwork—but history itself with a major incentive we will be including: authentic free coal raised from the wreckage of the Titanic. This coal will be included with specific rewards only.
Our theme’s mission in our gallery will also help promote and educate the historical significance of such a personal connection shared with the doomed ocean liner—through the artwork and preservation of it’s memory. Something we will continue through future themes presented in the success of this gallery being funded and built. 
Both online and with private showings, this showcase will feature original fine arts—curating paintings, sculptures, and other mixed media creations, spanning the imagination or historical contexts. Our plan is to maintain and establish our on-going website for the gallery, as well as the brick and mortar location physically of the private gallery. Generous pledges will also go towards materials and supplies needed to create these fine works of art: pencils, paints, and canvases to keep the passionate heart of art beating. And through this Kickstarter campaign, investors will have the chance to own or collect some of these original pieces! Many of which will be featured for a limited time in the gallery’s exhibition. Funding would also go towards the promotion of the gallery along with its building to attract savvy would be patrons.
The Original Paintings
“Into The Abyss” 
is an original concept illustrated and painted in traditional-mixed medium on a high-quality 22X30 inch illustration board. The mediums include: acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, pen, ink, and markers. This piece is based on research theories of how the bow section (front half) of the RMS Titanic came to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean. Study suggests the bow section measures approximately 470 feet long. Traveling at approximately 25 mph at a 45 degree angle, the bow section plunged into the sea floor—burying itself 60 feet into the mud. The foremast was torn down, falling onto the port bridge, along with the ship's wheelhouse being swept away. This haunting image illustrates the dark descent of the doomed ocean liner meeting its final resting place in the early hours on the morning of April 15th, 1912. The discovery of the wreckage came 73 years later by Robert D. Ballard and a team of reachers in 1985. The weight coupled with the speed that impacted upon an abrupt halt left this forward section of the ship badly damaged to which Ballard described “as if it had been squashed by a giant’s fist.” Despite the exterior’s condition—the bow’s descent and collision with the ocean floor still left this section in reasonably good condition—being slowly flooded created a relatively smooth descent mitigating the interior damage. In the grim distance of this artwork, a clouded settling of the imploded stern section (back half) can be seen falling into the debris field. On a personal note, to our knowledge, no other artist has captured this terminal impact concluding her final resting place.
“The Sinking Maiden”
is an original concept illustrated and painted in traditional-mixed medium on a high-quality approximately 19X30 inch illustration board. The mediums include: acrylic, watercolor, colored pencil, pen, ink, and markers. This piece depicts the beginning of the RMS Titanic’s descent into the Atlantic ocean in the hours of its sinking between April 14th—15th 1912. It’s final resting place became 12,500 feet beneath the ocean surface, leaving behind two debris fields covering 2 square miles separating the bow and stern sections that broke apart during the sinking—both sections are located 1,970 feet apart. The stern’s remains measure approximately 350 feet long and is almost unrecognizable, as it was catastrophically damage during it’s final descent. Survivors recounted hearing explosions seconds after the stern sank beneath the watery surface—air pockets imploding, coupled with the frigid temperatures and heated boilers literally caused the stern section to explode and disintegrate upon it’s descent. This artwork displays both the beauty of human achievement and tragic loss of life in this historical event. 
The Coal
Through this artistic Kickstarter patrons will have the unique opportunity to obtain coal that was retrieved from the debris field of the Titanic’s wreck. More than 80,00 clumps of coal that served as the blood of the world’s most famous ocean liner has been inventoried by weight and quantity with certification, import number, and date by the United States Customs Service as having been recovered from the Titanic. All of this is reflected and verified in it’s accompanying certificate of authenticity. This particular item is not only a small piece of history, but is growing more scarce with the passage of time, it is the only item allowed to be sold to the public. Each piece of coal we’ve curated for this Gallery’s Titanic Themed Exhibition has acted as “effort conservators” to Titanic’s deteriorating remnants; and these original keepsakes (keychain or coin) come as absolutely FREE incentives with our top-tier pledges.
The Relic Box
Our original hand-crafted Relic Boxes are the heart of this exhibit, embodying a miniaturized experience for investors and collectors. Each uniquely packaged exhibit come with the perfect set of conversation pieces for this exhibition. Everything about this part of the exhibit has been hand-finished and will be unique to every investor. Adorning the top is a sculpted replication of the Titanic’s bow wreckage, infused to the box as if it were raised from the depths of her final resting place. The interior of this showcase has a classy lid-support, with a miniature concept sketch that greets the opener under the lid. A faux leather liner caresses the bottom of it’s contents replicated within, the wood has been stained to meet it’s elegant presentation. Each box will include these original keepsakes: 2 canvas card reproductions of each of the main paintings, 1 original ink sketch card in the theme of Titanic, 1 replicated passenger contract Titanic ticket, 1 romanticized jewelry necklace embellished with Glebe artwork, and 1 free authentic coal keychain with its certificate of authenticity. Everything comes autographed and numbered in the collective Relic Box pledges. The Relic Box itself can be purchased individually in a separate pledge tier. 
3D ARTiFact Cards
 Each ARTiFact Card comes hand-sculpted and painted as if it were still resting somewhere in the darkness of Titanic’s debris field at the depth of 12,500 feet in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic. With each of these pieces being based on actual items salvaged from her wreckage, our artistic interpretation of these will be 1 of 1 recreations, crafted through a mixed medium process to replicate either the bell that was rung in Titanic’s fateful moments—or to something as personal as the pocket-watch a passenger carried with them on that ill-fated maiden voyage. These wooden-backed mini-masterpieces are replicated on a smaller scale and come in a sealed display case to protect the original art for years to come. The custom backs come signed and numbered; they can be purchased through individual or together pledges. 
Canvas Cards
Our canvas cards are exclusively produced for the Relic Box. These miniaturized reproductions of the main paintings come beautifully captured on 2.5x3.5 inch heavy-weight canvas stock, with a custom back that is signed and numbered. The two paintings are the face of The First Glebe Exhibit, capturing the dramatic final moments of the Titanic’s sinking, and her final decent as she crashed 60 feed in the mud and murk of the ocean floor.
Personal Sketch Cards
These mini-masterpieces are what we are known for! All originally hand painted and drawn in full color, we capture the vision of a commission for our clients. With this unique pledge patrons will be open to commission us in the gallery theme of the Titanic, or outside subject matter original to their own ideas. And yes, we can illustrate you like one of our “French girls.” Each PSC comes on a 2.5x3.5 inch heavy-weight card stock and custom back.
Original Ink Sketch Card
Our ink sketch cards come exclusively to the Relic Box, adding a sense of nostalgia and original art to the collection. Each ink card will be executed in the theme of the Titanic, covering everything from faces of the passengers, the captain, relics and scenes, as well as the ship herself in various stages of her life. Each card is illustrated strictly in back ink on aged paper, the wooden stock cards come with a custom back where they are signed and numbed—unique and in correlation to each Relic Box sold in the corresponding pledge tier. 
Replicated Passenger Contract Titanic Ticket
Exclusively replicated for our Relic Box, this third-class ticket was originally submitted into the national archive of the United States district courts; used as evidence during the investigation of Titanic tragedy and it’s massive loss of life. The highest percentage of victims were steerage, or “third cabin” passengers, who were mainly poor immigrants coming to start a new life in America. 
The Titanic Necklace
 This special keepsake was crafted by artist and designer Kathy Glebe. Capturing a beautiful rendition of our artwork on a wooden token and flanked by a starry metal backing, this piece is sure to generate interesting conversation to a classy look or a unique gift item. The Glebe Titanic Necklace is available in both gold or silver tone chain and charm. This elegant keepsake can be obtained in the collective Relic Box pledge tier or the Titanic jewelry (with matching earrings) pledge tier. 
The Prints
One of our most popular base products, our prints come in a plethora of collection options and pledge tiers to serve your collector needs! Whether you’re buying for your own curation, or to share as a gift with others, they will capture “Into the Abyss” and “The Sinking Maiden” in all their high-definition glory. The 11x17 inches poster prints pledge come signed and numbered to 1,912 available world wide, making them the more limited and sought after collectable of the print options."
84,84,"Chapter One is already available on my website mmcdonald77.wordpress.com/On Music. After an Introduction, about the music revolution of the sixties, we will take up lyrics as the key to the meaning of our music. We rarely try to think through the meaning of our songs, though amazing things, and occasional treasures, can be found there. Our course will also involve psychology, a study of love, and conclude in a discussion with Allan Bloom. The work is now in a final editing, and will be self published, perhaps through Mill Stream Publishing company. It is very exciting, and I expect the book to do quite well, in both general reading and as a college text."

Why a Raspberry Pi 3 instead of a Pi Zero?
By using a Raspberry Pi 3 instead of the much less powerful Pi Zero, you will have much greater capability such as playing many retro console games that will not run on the Pi Zero.  Furthermore, the integrated Bluetooth, WiFi, and full sized HDMI and USB ports eliminate the need for you to purchase the multiple adapters and extensions required for a Pi Zero system.  
What about Heat?
The Raspberry Pi 3 is known for overheating under heavy CPU loads. This problem is solved by integrating a cooling fan that is small enough to fit inside the cartridge and provides adequate airflow.  The fan keeps temperatures low even when running benchmark programs that max out all four processor cores for an extended period of time.  Cooling vents were integrated into the mounting bracket face so no holes need be cut into the cartridge itself.  A heatsink will also be provided with every kit.  You can feel confident that your Raspberry Pi will not overheat no matter how heavily you load its processor.  
How can a Raspberry Pi 3 fit into an NES Cartridge?
To get the Raspberry Pi 3 into the NES Cartridge it is necessary to remove the Ethernet port and the double stacked USB ports from the circuit board.  The integrated WiFi on the Raspberry Pi 3 all but eliminates the need for an ethernet port, and two USB ports are relocated to the face of the mounting bracket.  A driving factor in the design of this project was to keep the exterior of the NES cartridge unmodified so as to maintain the stock appearance of your cartridge.  However, it would be possible to cut slots into the side of the case and install two more USB ports if you need all four ports.  
What if I don't have the time, ability, or interest to build a project that requires soldering?
No problem!  Let me build your Pi3Cart for you.  Check out the assembled pledge level.
Thank you for checking out this project!
I have had a great deal of fun developing and building the Pi3Cart and want to share it with others.  I have built multiple Pi3Carts which I have shared with friends and family who love them.  Mine has become an integral part of my home entertainment system and makes a great conversation piece.  By selling kits on a pre-order basis I can order wholesale quantities of parts and reduce the kit cost, so that I can share the Pi3Cart with the world.  "

THE NEW CURRENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A shot from ""The Winter's Tale"" in 2014, Lion and Unicorn Theatre
THE GOAL
We are staging a gender-inverted, film noir-inspired musical production of Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew, at the New Wimbledon Studio Theatre, running 26th May - 20th June 2015.  But to truly make this dream a reality, we need your help.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Q:  Who are Arrows & Traps?
A:  We are a new London-based, non-profit, repertory theatre company made up of actors, puppeteers, clowns, choreographers, film makers, designers, and musicians - a diverse group of people with a vast array of different talents and experience, all united in our passion for re-inventing classic texts for modern audiences.  Our past work includes two critically acclaimed productions of Much Ado About Nothing and The Winter's Tale in 2014 at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre, and our next production is an epically gory Titus Andronicus in October 2015, but we're not limited to solely producing Shakespeare.  We have several esteemed patrons such as the master of the lexicon, actor and presenter Gyles Brandreth, as well as Olivier Award-winning West End actor David Bedella. 
Put simply, our mandate is to put on the best night's live theatre you can get for under £20.  We take an old tale, and we tell it in a way you've never seen before.  Our work is bold, it's unusual, it's unafraid of taking risks.  We've had a phenomenal first year, and cannot wait to show you what we've got planned next with Shrew.
""Exit pursued by a bear"" - The Winter's Tale 2014
Q:  What's so different about your production of Taming Of The Shrew?
A:  One of the main things that makes our show unique is that it is staged as a play within a play, where the roles and lines are swapped in a full cast gender inversion; which means every single character in the story has to be completely re-invented from scratch.  This is not the Shrew you know.  It will draw you into a world run by a matriarchy, where sons are sold off by their mothers to the highest bidder, where husbands are dragged off screaming by their wives; a world where women make the big decisions, and their men must live with the consequences.  This, for us, is our biggest excitement  - as it will allow our actors access to roles that they would never normally get to play, and as a team we will discover how this changes a tale we all think we know.  It's a love story of rebels, running from a world of rules and expectations, Shrew is often called ""a battle of the sexes"", but we are interested in what happens to that battle when the tables are turned.
Offie-Nominated Actress Elizabeth Appleby as Hermione in The Winter's Tale (2014)
Q:  Why did you choose to switch genders around?
A:  We certainly didn't take this decision lightly, and see it as far more than just a gimmick.  First of all, and this is quite important if you want your play to be entertaining (which we do), when you turn the Shrew (Katherine) into a man, and her tamer (Petruchio) into a woman, you instantly inject back some of the fierce humour that Shakespeare originally intended, which modern audiences arguably struggle to find sometimes.  But more than this, we wanted find out what happens when you take a story of female powerlessness and male dominance, and flip it completely on its head.  Is it still cruel?  Is it still a love story?  Is it worse now that a woman is doing the taming?  Is it more palatable now that the victim is a man? 
We want to explore male helplessness, to question what would make a man be deemed by society as ""shrewish"", and how would a conservative and oppressive society resolve that.  We want to find out what a female society is like when it hasn't had to deal with male validation.  We even want to explore the issue of a particular form of domestic violence that is often ignored or trivialised, namely when it is a man who is the victim.  We want to find out whether love can survive in a world that is revolving about wealth and worth, and how truly you can ever really know another person when everyone around you is pretending to be someone else.  In short, we want to give the Shrew back its teeth.
Much Ado About Nothing (2014)
 Q:  Is it still Shakespeare?
A:  Absolutely.  The text is a slightly cut-down version of the original, running at just over 90 minutes.  Shakespeare's words are still here (except for his choices of pronouns of course), and we want, above all, to stay true to his intentions.  But we think this is a version of the story that he would have approved of.  He was an adaptor, he took well-known myths and stories, and he made them his own.  We think he wrote to make people think about the world they lived in, to question whether love can ever triumph over all, to investigate how much we are defined by our parents' opinions of us, to argue over whether a true rebel's heart can ever truly be tamed, or rather is it quietened only when it is understood?  This is a play that Shakespeare wanted to create debate with, and we think somewhere along the line our collective modern sensibilities have blocked our sightline to this.  The only way then is re-invent it to the point where we can experience it again like new.
Q:  Where does my money go?
A:  There are no fat full coffers in our production company.  We do this for the love.  We work in day jobs, teach, wait tables, give out flyers, drink too much coffee, have fever dreams about lost props or forgotten lines, think constantly obsessively about Shakespeare, and never want to change a single minute of it.  Anything you give will go directly into making the show happen.  It will buy costumes for our leading ladies, props for our clowns, an hour's rental of a rehearsal studio; every single penny will be driven straight back into making this our best show yet. 
The heart of our production are our actors, we'd be nowhere without them, so a large portion of any donations we receive will go towards a fair and honest wage for their hours of hard work.  And we're not talking hundreds of pounds a day and their own trailer filled with blue M&Ms here, we're talking about the basic minimum wage in the UK.  There are, of course, other vital things that the productions needs, as nothing comes for free, but it is our hope that we can raise enough money to both satisfy the vision that our production team has, as well as offering the fair rate that the cast deserve.
If you would like to know more about how the budget breaks down for our production, here's a helpful pie-chart...

PRODUCTION DATES:
New Wimbledon Studio Theatre (May 26th - June 20th 2015)
Tickets for the show are available here
There will be a press and industry night on May 27th to which several of the higher-end perks on offer get you free tickets to.  This is a chance to meet the cast and creatives involved in the show, and be right at the nexus of London's vibrant Off West End Theatre industry.

Making merch takes a lot of time/money especially for the vision I had so I'm launching this page for people who have the same interest to help me reach my goal.   
I want to make a set of  4-6 (maybe more) hard enamel pins of my favorite jrocker's guitars: Kaoru (Dir en Grey) hide (X) Uruha (theGazettE) etc.! Most of the funds will go into paying for production of the mold which is the most expensive for the size I want them to be: 8cm, coming out to almost $100 USD for each. They will each come wit two tacks and metal securing nubs on the back. If this project goes well I would also be excited to make more stretch designs to expand the collections. 
Here is the chart information supplied to me by the manufacturer with the material and and prices for the mold. All of them will come out to be about the same price.

If you have suggestions for other guitar designs you want to see added please please feel free to send a message whenever you'd like!!

89,89,"TRU’Nation was developed at Park University in Parkville, Missouri, as a result of studying and implementing Park University’s commitment to its core values of inclusivity, global citizenship, and accountability. TRU’Nation is a spiritually-based organization, designed to empower youth and to engage the community. Its purpose is to help disadvantaged and socio-economically challenged adolescents and young adults achieve success in the world, both during and after their college careers. In this proposal, I will illustrate the need for such a venture by first providing research-based evidence on why TRU’Nation is both a worthy investment and a powerful change-agent for society as a whole. Then, I will illustrate my strategic three-step process on how TRU’Nation will be collaboratively developed and implemented. Finally, I will use comparative data on why I believe TRU’Nation will be successful and provide goals with measurable outcomes to demonstrate how TRU’Nation will show evidence of achievement to investors. TRU’Nation is a collaborative venture designed to support adolescent students (in high school and college) achieve success by providing them with resources to meet basic needs. Often, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are worried about not having enough food to eat, school supplies, transportation and medical support. In addition to lacking basic resources, many of the disadvantaged youth who live in high crime areas tend to avoid public places, because they fear being harmed. This unsafe and exclusive lifestyle prevents our disadvantaged youth from developing and growing both cognitively and socially, which can inhibit their ability to achieve success in college as well as prevent assimilation into society. Museums, parks and other educational opportunities are often frequented by families and individuals who live and work in safe, financially stable communities. The disadvantaged youth in our area are prohibited from these wonderful and educationally stimulating opportunities, because they cannot access the areas due to safety concerns and lack of financial resources. TRU’Nation is designed to change that, to develop an inclusive and globally-responsive program, which incorporates not only meeting the basic needs of our disadvantaged youth, but also developing them into becoming culturally and socially-responsive, high-achieving citizens."

The Farm Lab at Petty Ranch Education Program
Farm Lab
SEEAG believes food literacy should be a right not a privilege. Agricultural education should be free to all kids. With your generous support, SEEAG's Farm Lab at Petty Ranch Education Program will be 100% cost free and will enable our organization to educate thousands of kids about the importance of agriculture and the science behind healthy farm ecosystems.
Our goal is to provide over 4,000 school children with cost-free outdoor education during the 2016-17 school year. Reaching our $25,000 will provide: 
School bus transportation
Farm Lab supplies 
The creation of a mobile farm-to-food classroom, which will provide direct access to a science-based agricultural lab on school premises.
If our Kickstarter campaign reaches the $25,000 goal, SEEAG promises to educate over 4,000 students. That's only $6.25 per student.  
Sample of some program costs:
School bus transportation - $250 per bus x 67 trips = $16,750 for 4,000 students total
Large outdoor classroom shade tent (army tent) - $2,500
Tuff Shed for storing supplies - $3,500
Observation beehive - $500
Compost storage bins - $500 x 3 
Worm bins - $250
Even with America's rich agricultural heritage, children fail to make the connection between the acres of farmland to the food on their tables. SEEAG's 100% cost-free Farm Lab Education Program helps make that connection. SEEAG opens children's eyes to the meaning of agriculture, and creates conscientious consumers, agricultural ambassadors, and future stewards of family farmland. 
The program teaches kids that healthy soil = healthy plants = healthy animals/insects = healthy people.
Furthermore, there is currently no national food literacy curriculum that teaches kids about the farm origins of food. SEEAG teaches the next generation to care about farmland, farms, farmers, and our agricultural workforce who work very hard everyday to make sure we have food on our tables. Our program instills pride in our youth whose family members are already an integral part of the food system.
SEEAG has taught over 15,000 K-12 students since 2008, and we want to reach more! 
Through the support of people like you, we are able to provide a 100% cost-free program to underserved schools. Our goal is to expand our scope of work with the new Farm Lab at Petty Ranch. We need funds to provide free school-to-farm transportation and Farm Lab materials, including a mobile farm-to-food classroom, which will provide direct access to a science-based agricultural lab on school premises.  
Your help will make a difference in the lives of 4,000 children.  
Thank you for your support. 
Sincerely,
Team SEEAG
Letters from kids are the best testimonials
We hope to reach our goal by October, National Farm to School Month

 Stretch Goals
Upon on meeting our initial goal, we went through the feedback we received during the campaign so far and looked at what we could build on top with the extra funding that would be both within the scope of the project, and would support the requests we received. Here are the Stretch Goals for the campaign so far:
Stretch Goal #1 - Accelerate PlayStation 4 support. ✅
 Stretch Goal #2 - 50 more challenges in the Early Access. 🔲

Antstream as a company has been in existence since 2014, but the first line of code dates back to 2008!  It started as a bedroom project for Steve Cottam, who is the CEO and founder.  One of the original anecdotes that drove this idea was noting how at gaming / entertainment conventions the arcade cabinet running something like Pong would be the biggest draw every time!  He realised then that retro was cool, it was desired, but it was not easily accessible…and so Antstream was born.
Obviously Steve has needed help along the way, and the team you see have a wealth of experience and credits to their names.  The team is made up of poly skilled engineers who cover a wealth of programming languages covering classic and modern computing environments, as well as infrastructure engineers, and operations experts.  Not to mention content and licensing specialists, and UX consultants to make sure everything works together to provide a good user experience, which is after all what Antstream is all about.  The team have written games/worked for companies like Nintendo, Sega, Atlus, Square Enix, Ocean, and Konami, as well as more than a dash of the corporate and financial worlds in Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and Compaq / HP.

The wider team (some not shown) include the co-founders of Playdemic, and TT games, the ex-CEO of Sega Europe, and the lifetime president of Eidos, who is our Chairman Ian Livingstone CBE.
Some interesting facts about the team: 
They have worked on AI for spacecraft systems 
They have worked on hits such as the Repton series, Ravenskull and Pipeline Plus 
They have remixed C64 tracks for Chris Abbott's ""Back in Time"" albums 
They have written emulators for the Spectrum and BBC Micro 
Written game scripts, and articles for publications like Retro Gamer, Retro Survival, and Edge 
Produced arcade conversions for Midnight Resistance, Cabal, and Road Runner 
Been programming games for more than 30 years 
Won ENnie awards as a fantasy illustrator 
Earned a Guinness world record for Dragon's Lair being the largest video game ported to the ZX81 
One of them even wrote and sang the theme tune for a glove puppet called Helix D Monster!  
As you can see, it's a multi-talented and broadly skilled team, and there is a clear flare for gaming and specifically retro games.  Not only can these folks produce magic, they are passionate about doing it! 
What does each reward mean? 
 Subscription time to the Antstream Retro Gaming platform. When we launch the service in the summer this year, backers with this reward will have access to it immediately, for a period of time corresponding to the level of their pledge. 
 Lifetime subscription to Antstream Retro Gaming service. When we launch the service in the summer this year, and for as long as the service runs,  backers with this reward will have access to it immediately, for as long as the service is running and publicly available. 
 Early Access to Antstream. Backers with this rewards will be able to connect to and use the Antstream service two weeks after the end of the campaign, before everyone else. It will be available on PC, Mac, Xbox, and Android devices. We will not count the duration of the Early Access against your Antstream subscription time. 
 Access to the Kickstarter backers Discord channel. Before the official launch of Antstream, we will open a channel on our Discord server that will be exclusively accessible to the Kickstarter backers with this reward. 
 Founder/VIP Title on Discord. On our Discord server, backers with this reward will receive the corresponding role title. 
 Founder/VIP Title in the Antstream interface. On Antstream, backers with this rewards will have the corresponding title on their profile, and their avatar will have a frame exclusive to the backers with this reward. 
 Fixed subscription price for Antstream Retro Gaming service forever. Backers with this reward will never have to pay more than the stated price for the service yearly subscription, for as long as the service is running and publicly available. 
 Challenges unlocked at launch. Games that come with Challenges all have their first challenge unlocked to everyone. Further level are unlocked using the gems earned through playing Challenges. Backers with this reward also have extra challenges unlocked among the ones available at the launch of the platform. 
 Add your own retro game to Antstream. This reward is strictly for game developers with a game playable on a retro platform that they would like to see on Antstream. Contractual clauses apply, you can get in touch with us through the campaign to discuss them. We reserve the right to decline any game that would not be fit for our platform, in which case we would refund the pledge. 
 Name & Design a challenge. Backers with this reward will be invited to select a game from the Antstream library and work with our team to design a new challenge for it. They will be able to name the challenge in question, but we reserve the right to refuse names that we would find inappropriate and/or offensive. In those cases, we will work together with the backer to find a suitable name. Note that not all games can support challenges, don’t hesitate to get in touch during the campaign if you wish to know more. 
 Beat My Score. Backers with this rewards will be given the opportunity to choose a game, play it with us, and set the default high score for that game, with their name or handle, as supported by the game as the default high score for everyone on the  platform. We reserve the right to refuse names that we would find inappropriate and/or offensive. In case multiple people selecting the same game, we would allow them all to set their names in the high score table, as long as the game permits enough names to be listed.
We are putting the final touches to the service at the moment, and we believe that it will be available to all this summer.
 As we are getting closer to our launch date, we felt that a crowdfunding campaign was a good way for us to do a number of things: 
We will learn from our prospective audience ahead of launch. This will allow us to serve them better, for example by installing servers in the regions where demand will be highest. 
We will start engaging with the fans about the games that will be available. We want the service to be built as a community space, and a crowdfunding campaign seems like a great way to start the conversation. 
We have many fans who have been supportive of our project over the years, this is also a way for us to offer them an opportunity to get their Antstream subscription at a much lower price point from the offering we will have at launch of $10 per month. 
 We hope this will help to spread the word about Antstream far and wide.  
The funds collected will all go towards development of the platform, as well as adding more games and features. If the Kickstarter campaign does not reach its goal, it will not change our release schedule in any significant way. However, it might mean we will prioritise development differently."
92,92,"In ""Rebound,"" a movie star (Tristan Lloyd Goddard) and a struggling actor (Virgil Eisen Fluesen) compete for the same role in a Broadway play - Who gets the part? Well, that's up to a very divided and volatile casting team. The play has been aptly described as ""an exploration of the nature of bonding and friendship amidst the chaos of the casting process.""
On October 27th, 2016 and May 5th, 2018, ""Rebound"" had public staged readings at K/Q Playwrights and HB Studio, respectively. The extremely positive audience reactions and feedback we received at both readings convinced us that the play deserves an Off-Broadway production, which brings us to the fundraising we are attempting on Kickstarter. 
Rather than send the play to literary agents and theater producers, and wait for a response, we've decided to go grass roots with our Kickstarter Campaign, and raise the funds necessary to produce the play ourselves.  In addition to being actors and playwrights, both of us have vast theatrical production experience. Dan Haft was a co-founder and Producing Director of The Sackett Group, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit theater company, between 1990 and 2007. David Logan Rankin was Co-Artistic Director (with Scott Cargle) of The Theater Exchange in Houston, Texas from 1982-86, as well as a key acting member and stage manager for the late James Gale's Urban Theater Company from 1989- 1994. Upon his return to New York City, Mr. Rankin was a key actor and designer for The Shakespeare Project from 1996 - 2005, and worked as Managing Director for TSP from 2003 - 2005. As a playwright, David was  co-translator of a new translation of Sartre's No Exit, as well as an Artist-in-Residence for Mabou Mines with his play Mister Nameless Returns in their 2001-2002 Artist Suite. His other plays include A Break From the Routine, Two Cats Talking and A Lamentation On the Demise of the Romanticism of Smoking, all of which have been given professional readings in New York City.
Our intention is to keep intact the wonderful cast who performed the reading of Rebound at HB Studio, including (in order of appearance):

Demo - 50-60 minutes
Full - 5-6 hours
Thank you for your votes in Steam Greenlight! We are in!
It’s the story of a guy who lives in a post-apocalyptic desert world. He’s quite a bright fella, so he easily and lively wriggles out of any difficulties that come at him, saves the world, and seduces girls (18+). He never gives up and eventually succeeds. Just like we do :) 
Wars, fights, shootings, chases – the life of a field agent in all its glory, including adventures, love, and romance. In the full version, there will be giant battle robots too.
The game will contain fiction, mysticism, and Ecchi.
Strip mini-game
Furthermore, you will come across at least 9 logical mini-games along the story. Three of them are done and included in the demo version. One even involves stripping. You will be able to skip the mini games, find them later in a special gallery, and play them as much as you like. This means you’re buying 10 games for the price of one!
Many beautiful backgrounds and CG’s
A whole bunch of charismatic characters
Animated graphics
Full motion videos on the game engine
Captivating story line

The novel will be sold at a reasonable price. We don’t need much, the game will be easily affordable for everyone.
There once was an ordinary guy and his health was poor. So poor that the state granted him a disablement allowance. Only this allowance was much too small to live on. Therefore, he had to find a job.
This guy also had a dream. Not just any dream, but a Dream – with a capital D. He dreamt of making a great visual novel. As it’s not something he could do on his own, he decided to put together a team of developers. He found other disabled people and started paying them with his allowance money. He helped them a lot by doing this because they didn’t have jobs or allowances.
Another mini-game
The team was very happy and everyone did their best, which lead to an excellent demo version of the future game that you can download right now by clicking the link. Then the guy decided that everyone deserved a bonus for such an excellent job. Then he thought – “Why not raise some money on a crowd funding platform?” And that’s how this page was made.
 And now a few words about the creators of the game.
Plot and idea author – Vladimir Petrov (diabetes, hypertension). The guy who started it all. He is an infinitely cheerful comedian, who’s love of life is contagious and who’s sharing his big Dream with us.
Artist – Vladimir Litau (arm fracture). Despite him breaking an arm in an accident, he kept drawing sprites without even waiting for the cast to come off.
Background designer – Maksim Sakun (constant colds). Volunteered to help and now draws beautiful 3-D backgrounds for us. There wasn’t anything left of the allowance to pay him, so he is working for absolutely free!
Composer – Aleksei Demidov (spinal fracture). A very talented musician, whose compositions wonderfully complement our visual novels. He is a fine nature and a good person.
Scriptwriter, programmer, designer – Ruslan Nebykov (multiple concussions, allergies, hypertension). He is helping to create the novel. Responsible for writing the script, the code and the mini games. His dream is to write books. The hole in his head doesn’t stop him from writing daring and clever stories.
Translator – Yuliya Cherkasova. Our princess. We decided not to draw her cartoon version; in our team, she’s the only one who’s normal and healthy, besides that, she is simply a wonderful person.
We’re not asking money for treatment and we don’t need charity! We are selling copies of our future game. We only need a bit of financial help from our future readers to finish the novel.
We are laughing about our ""cripple team"" ourselves - just look at our comical portraits. You too should see this all as a joke.
What’s more, this story is for those whose life isn’t too sweet either. If you have a dream then nothing can get in your way! There might even be people who would want to help a “cripple team” to release an awesome game. We’re not promising you logo tees or posters with our characters. We simply don’t have time for that because we’re working on the game day and night. Instead, we will pay you back in keys to the game we will release on Steam. The most generous of you will get special thanks in the credits. It may not be much but it’s from all our hearts! Remember, the world is what you make of it. Follow your Dreams and you’ll do great!
It's quite difficult to make a game on 1000$. But we intentionally lowered our goal amount to raise at least some money. We will finish the novel in any case, even if we don't raise any money!
If we raise enough money for a bonus that’ll be great. Nevertheless, if it turns out that we raised more than the goal amount, we will start working on the second part of the game right after the first part is released. It will be even more entertaining and exciting!
The full version of the game will be released in autumn of this year - winter at the latest. Watch out for new game releases on Steam.
P.S.:
We estimate the development of the game takes one year. If the fee each team member will be $ 300 per month, then we need $ 18,000. If we do not reach this amount, we will not get anything. But we would be very useful to any money. So we decided not to ask too much.

Hey guys, we launched this Kickstarter campaign to fund our album ""Seelenfresser"" and we need your help to make it happen! You can choose your reward or just send us few dollars because you like our music and appreciate the hard work we put in. Thank you so much!"
95,95,"     The money will be used to hire the four main actors who are based throughout the book in addition to extras depending on the event taking place such as the famous Halloween party in whichTangie boldly dressed up as a hooker for the evening and had everyone's attention the entire evening including Marcus whom she was mad at for a moment for bringing another girl to her party, the first football game that Tangie and best friend Diana attended, the Oakland New Age night scene in which her and three of her girlfriends almost ended up in San Jose, California being threatened to sell their bodies after jumping in the car with old childhood friends, luckily a faithful one took over the wheel and took them back home and told them to ""Stop jumping in the car with any old Tom Ick or Harry. All funds generated will go towards production. The film will be mostly based out of Richmond, California. We will be using all three of the high schools in the city of Richmond for extras as it is a teenage oriented movie.
      It will also help pay for our movie producer ""Da Professor"" for his expert producing services in helping us to achieve success of a block buster movie."

Goblins. We usually see these mischievous, green creatures as obstacles for your adventuring party. Killing goblins means easy experience for a lowly adventurer. Kissing goblins on the other hand…
You’re in for a far greater adventure!
 “A goblin dating simulator & TTRPG inspired visual novel. Explore the world, meet new characters, and make choices that decide your story!”
Hidden Treasures is a dating simulator AND visual novel that draws inspiration from Tabletop Role-Playing Games. You play as the main character in your own adventure, meeting characters and making choices that guide your story. Also to be clear this IS a dating sim but the romantic and flirt options are outlined so if you wanted to just spend time in a friendly fashion through a character's route you can!
Do you find choose-your-own-adventure books exciting? Are you a fan of dating games looking for something new? Do you just want to date goblins?
If you said no, don’t worry. You may just find this game is a hidden treasure…
You can find our Twitter here AND you can play our demo here!
 In Hidden Treasures, there will be times when you will roll a number based on your character’s attributes to determine an outcome: That’s where the TTRPG elements come in.
If a choice you want to make requires a lot of strength when you make that choice your strength stat and a random number from 1-20 will decide if you succeed or fail. You can make choices that play to your strengths, or take a risk. If between dates you'll have downtime where you can go to different areas in the village or surrounding area and come across plenty of random encounters. Some of them will even start up side quests that will give you an extra side story to follow! 
Even if you fail, that doesn’t mean game over! Failure doesn’t mean a negative outcome. Instead of closing a door, it can open up a new path for you to take and explore!
 Every day you spend in this new world will present you with options. Where will you go? Who will you spend time with? Take goblins on dates, aid them in their quests, or forge your own path. The choice is up to you!
 Hidden Treasures has eight main characters, with their own unique stories. Who will you help? Who will you befriend? Who will YOU fall in love with?
Callo
Krieve
Lynn
Oskar
Siobhan
Stab
Stendra
Tahuun
Your character is your own creation! This game lets you:
 Choose a name for them.
   Choose from three different classes: Fighter (sword and shield), Ranger (bow and arrow), and Wizard (spells and more spells!)
   Pick their personality as you play, with a variety of dialogue options for every situation. No more choosing between just “nice” or “mean!”
   Decide who they romance! Your character will in love with our charming cast of characters… and maybe you will too!
   Enjoy your digital copy of Hidden Treasures! The game will be available for both Mac and PC! 
 Want to take a look at all the concept art designs we've worked on over the development of this project? The artbook will be full of early to late designs, different outfits, sketches, and more by each of the contributing artists! It will be sent out as a digital PDF and if possible we'll contact backers for early versions of a physical version when available. 
STICKERS! A full sticker set, 3x3 in of the main cast of eight for you to put anywhere and take with you! On a bag? Absolutely! On a computer? Of course! On a greatsword? Maybe not functional but it'll look great!
 There's a lot of narrative choices and options that go into this game and we want your help in discovering what does and doesn't work. Even if you go through and the only thing you have to say is that you liked it, that helps! This tier is beta access to early scenes over development to get your feedback and help us shape it to be the best game possible for you!
 Do you have an original character you'd like to show up? At the beginning of the game, which you can see in the demo above, there are 3 characters that appear to chat with you. In the full version of the introduction, there will be random characters that pop up to mention a line or two of dialogue which could be a character of your design! The final character sprite will also be sent to you as a high-quality image to save.
 Not only do you get to create a an NPC to appear in the game but you'll also be able to choose which of the main 8 you'd like them to interact with. Create a situation where another ranger challenges Callo to an archery contest. Do you have an idea of someone who thinks they could out drink Lynn? Is there are a strange creature that Siobhan would encounter in the woods that they can't help but want to catch? Let's find out together!
Let's have a one on one and figure out exactly how this came to be! Gabe will take you out through the power of technology! (Video Call) to a Coffee shop, park, or other general date location of your choice and you'll sit down to hear some of the more personal details of the game. What did it take, what were some of the hardest parts, what parts specifically were inspired by personal events (more than you might think) and how do they fit in?
 ADD-ONS
(If you'd like more than one key, you may add $10 to your KS pledge for a max of 2 keys/$20 for an extra 2 keys sent to you upon release. You may do this at any tier! To do this you go to your pledge and click the manage your pledge option, and change amount. Then you just add in the value!)
 The digital pin-up calendar will not have full nudity and will in fact be PG-13+. It will be from January - December 2020!
 The second act will focus more on the relationship that you've built up and how it helps resolve conflict depending on your choices made in the first act. Reaching the second act will also be dependant on a key choice you'll have to make at the end of the first act.  
 New areas mean sometimes you'll need different equipment and will need to be differently outfitted! We wanted to actively portray that and give you more places to discover, more lore to experience, and more fashion to appreciate. 
 This game has a fairly big cast and whether we want to give them all voice versus whether we can are two different things but at this goal, we'll be able to give each character a voice like we've been hoping to do!


Backer Goals
 First backer goal of 200 unlocked!
So we actually just hit our first backer goal! We wanted to give you more depth on the goblins so because of that, each of the main 8 will be getting a 4-page comic giving you a little bit of background of their younger days for a 32-page digital comic! For all backers!
 Second backer goal of 500 unlocked!
This one for our 5E players!  Explore the HT world at your tables! New subclasses, NPCs, items, and even a little DM chart for adding in some romance aspects for relationships with NPCs and their reactions

Reaching a total number of backers to each of these goals will unlock something special that will be released for free and available for everyone who backed the Kickstarter regardless of the tier. Some of them will be especially exciting for those of you who played a specific tabletop that involves dungeons.  When they're reached we'll announce here what exactly you unlocked!
Have you ever wanted advice from a motherly assassin goblin? Here's your chance! For every 50 retweets on our pinned tweet for the Kickstarter, you'll be getting a little clip animation of motherly advice from romance options Stab's mother! (voiced by Gabe's actual mother!) Some sympathetic, some stabby!
This game is possible because of the hard-working group of people that make up this team. Everyone had a main role but there was no lacking in the team reaching out to help each other to make sure that we stayed on track and could create something astonishing.

 The split-up of the money is pretty straight forward. We've made sure to include a reasonable budget for the art and design because with a game like this it does take a lot!"

'Tis the season! Upon doing a search for pins for Pride, I found that many options are limited to rainbows and unicorns - I wanted to create a pin that was straight to the point, out, proud, and inclusive! These enamel pins represent LGBTQIA+ self-love and allyship and are a proclamation of Pride all year long. A portion of all sales after production will benefit a rotating selection of LGBTQIA+ charities (local and national). Unfortunately for me, this fancy rainbow coating runs a higher minimum than my normal pins - so I'm reaching out to you for pre-ordering goodness!
Pins are soft enamel with rainbow anodized metal and 1.25” (about 35mm) in size, with pink rubber backings. All pins come packaged on a customized backing card.
Your pledge will go toward:
Production of pins and backing cards (90%) 
Shipping and shipping materials (5%) 
GOALS
$500 | Metallic PridePins are Produced! 
$600 | Pride design stickers ship with each order! 
$700 | Surprise MINI PIN unlocked and ships with each order!
Want a look at the backer goods? The pink heart backs, greeting cards, and bonus pin pictures are shown below! Note: the bonus pin and the surprise bonus pin that unlocks at $700 are two different designs! That means there's the potential to receive two different bonus pins!!
TIMELINE
June - July: Kickstarter campaign 
July - August: Production 
August: Shipping

Hi! I'm Jonathan Kamens. I maintain ten different add-ons for the Mozilla Thunderbird email app, and I need your help to be able to keep doing that. If you use any of my add-ons and you want to keep using them past 2020, please read on!
Thunderbird is a great application, but sometimes people want it to do things differently, either because they have a different vision for how the app should behave, or because it's impossible for the folks who maintain Thunderbird to include every feature that anyone wants. That's where add-ons come in.
The first add-on I started maintaining, nearly a decade ago, was Send Later. Send Later allows users to write emails now and schedule them to be delivered later, either just once or on a schedule. I wanted to be able to do that, but the original author of Send Later was no longer maintaining it and it was no longer working, so I took on the challenge of fixing it.
Since Send Later, I've either written from scratch or taken over maintenance of eleven other add-ons, nine of which (Folder Pane View Switcher, Show All Body Parts, IMAP Received Date, Enhanced Priority Display, Reply to Multiple Messages, Toggle Replied, userChromeJS, Undigestify, and Remote Content By Folder), are still active.
All my add-ons have always been entirely free. Although I've accepted donations to support development of some of my add-ons, those donations have always been entirely voluntary, and most users do not donate.
Up until about a year ago, the code within Thunderbird that supports add-ons was pretty stable, so the effort required to keep existing add-ons working was minimal. However, about a year ago, the maintainers of Thunderbird start down a path of changes which force add-on maintainers to rewrite all of their add-ons before the release of Thunderbird 78, which is currently scheduled for June 2020.
Those changes began before the release of Thunderbird 68 in August 2019. Although it was difficult, I was able to fix most of my add-ons for compatibility with Thunderbird 68, and therefore most of my users have been able to continue using them as they've switched to the new Thunderbird version. However, the changes coming in Thunderbird 78 are much more extensive, and I will need to do a lot more work on my add-ons for Thunderbird 78 than I did for 68. It's simply too much work for me to sustain continuing to do it for just voluntary donations.
Therefore, I have made the difficult decision to switch to a subscription model for my add-ons. Once Thunderbird 78 is released, my add-ons will require licenses to use, priced as follows:
$5 per year per user for a single add-on
$10 per year per user for three add-ons
$25 per year per user for all add-ons
$50 for a perpetual license for one user for all add-ons
I've launched this Kickstarter campaign because I can't proceed unless about 10% of my add-ons' current users commit in advance to keep using and paying for them.
Otherwise, I'm afraid when Thunderbird 78 is released my add-ons will stop working, except for the ones that someone else steps forward and volunteers to take over and update.
And you know what? It would be awesome if someone else took over my add-ons and continued to maintain them for free, just as I took over Send Later years ago. I love and believe in free software, so that would actually be the ideal outcome as far as I'm concerned. I've tried to find people to do that, but so far I've been unsuccessful. As far as I'm concerned, switching to a licensing model like this is actually the lesser of two evils; it's either this or abandon my add-ons completely and leave all of my users in the lurch, which I'd really rather not do if I can avoid it.
This Kickstarter campaign may actually help me find people willing to take over my add-ons and maintain them for free. If this campaign succeeds, and some of my add-ons do get adopted by new maintainers, then I'll pay them from the proceeds of the campaign. Having that on offer may help me attract new maintainers for my add-ons, so you may get to keep using the add-ons for free even after the licenses I'm offering in this campaign would have expired."
99,99,"II wrote this play. Its very encouraging and will help many. I want to audition people for the play. I will rent a building to hold auditions, and to practice the performance. We will then rent a auditorium and produce the play. We will buy costumes and materials to make it happen. This play will bless many and give hope to people that they van make it in this world know matter what, cause yes ANGELS ARE WATCHING OVER US."
