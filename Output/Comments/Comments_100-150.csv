In case anyone is interested, I have added support to the Arduino Nano firmware for GPS and automatic daylight savings time transitions. A fork of the code with the necessary changes is available at:
https://github.com/NedFreed/TFWordclock
The hardware mod necessary is quite simple: Attach a GPS module's Rx/Tx lines to digital I/O pins D4 and D5. With the new firmware in place the GPS will be detected and used automatically. The one second blinking LED is used as an indicator that the GPS is present and working: It now blinks in response to GPS data. (It's also a lot more accurate now...)
The time zone offset and daylight savings time rules are all built in at compile time. A modified version of the time zone dump utility zdump is provided which can be used to dump the zone information in the correct format from any computer that has the necessary zone files.
Comments are welcome.

Hello David,
Got my kit. All assembled and works just fine. I wonder if you were thinking about making a group order for a 3D printed case? Maybe you have one already developed?

That was also my point with some investors that will like to pushing me into the 60 minutes version of the TV SHOW. It's good to se what the audience think, also to show these data to the Producers that sometimes they think they are speaking for the audience :) thanks for this!
FOR PEOPLE THAT DIDINT FOLLOW ALL THE DISCUSSION: IT was a polemic about make a 30 minutes Tv show (short but focus the money in production) or a 60 minutes version (with more story but less visual quality). All related from the fact we will have the same budget.

Saw the update,
I say 30 mins if you drag the story you might lose the views I say leave something at the end of each episode so we want more like a WTF moment like the old ""24"" series I use to watch those and loved it. The new ""24"" does not capture it to me. Don't know if it's the actor or the story.

Hi Robertus,
Thanks.
Good idea on the Concept Art Rewards, I just added an option for all 8 ($40).

Robertus
over 8 years ago
Hi Darrell,
Yes, clear and take your time about the quality of the models, sure
I was looking at the 8 available packages
There is a pledge with a max of 5, I was pointing in this direction ;)
To me I would gladly spent some extra for a pledge with 8 packs (and to support the project via this route)
Succes!
Darrel AndersonCreator
over 8 years ago
Thanks Artie, we are very excited about it, ant woking hard to make it fly.
Hi Robertus,
Thanks for the feedback. Nice to see another GroBoto owner/artist here.
We will release several models very quickly after funding is achieved. However, there are only a few that are ready for release. For most models, significant work is needed to get each one ready.
That is, naturally, the purpose of the project ...to support the work needed to prepare each model for release. It's vital to refine and organize the models so that each is truly useful to other artists. I would not want to simply dump all of this work — in its raw creatively-cahaotic state — out there in the world. That would likely lead to problems and frustration for those endeavoring to use the work.
If the work was ready for distribution, there would be no real need for this project. That said, we will do everything possible to release the models quickly — I was perhaps a bit conservative in my projection of the pace, but wanted to insure that I was allowing enough time to release quality models.
About your suggestion for 'pledges with more digital copies' -- what were you hoping to see? More Concept Art Packages, or was that part of your notion about including models in the rewards?
In any case, please know that I am as anxious to make these models available quickly as you are to have them in hand.
Best Wishes,
Darrel
Robertus
over 8 years ago
I already have a Groboto license
It would be nice to have pledges with more digital copies ?
The native Groboto files / obj formats: it would be great to have them earlier
They are already planned to be available if I have read well
It will pull people I think / hope if these files are added somehow at pledges and via this way earlier available to backers ?

As written in the reward description : ""Get EARLY ACCESS to the game once it goes live on Steam or wait a bit and get a DRM free key at full release!"" Also we never promised GOG keys explicitly, and have a limited access to those. However DM me and I'll hook you up with one!

Hi - I completely forgot I backed this game until I logged into Kickstarter today for the first time in a couple of years. It looks like it's all gone well, except I have no idea how to get my steam key to play. I'm assuming my email went into spam a while ago, and thus has been lost to digital oblivion... Can anyone help?

I've been playing this quite a lot by now, I like what has been done and where it is going. But I am missing the very thing I wanted most of all. ""Pure ASCII mode"" was promised boldly in the campaign and otherwise I would not have backed it. Please get this working! I am sure there are many other backers that care as much about this is I do and are still waiting impatiently.
ChaosForge LtdCreator
about 1 year ago
The mode is actually in the game (accessible by passing --console on the command line - this is pure SSH compatible ASCII output) but it's a bit broken - we need to put aside some time to fix and polish it, however we're crunching on more important (for the general populace ofc) features like melee and master traits, so it will take a bit more until we can sit and focus on ASCII mode. Apart from pure ASCII we will probably have also terminal emulation, and both of those features will be polished before 1.0 release!

Yes,. happened again. I load the game, am able to select ""tutorial"". The splash screen appears, I hear birdsong. Then everything stops.
And I mean everything. Control panel won't respond, nothing except actually powering down the PC. Major huge crash.
I won't try again on this PC, I will try again on my new one which arrived, and let you know if that works. But my current PC (apart from being windows 7) is a reasonable spec gaming machine that runs pretty much everything, so I'm a little puzzled why it's not behaving with Farmer's Life. Can send system specs if it would help you?

I checked further down in the comments and saw where the log files are. I've emailed the log files from yesterday's crash, and today's. The log files stop at exactly the same point, so that's presumably where it's worth looking first.

I am so glad to hear that they got to you safely! Yes, I really try to pre-make my pins when I can afford to. It gives me piece of mind to know exactly how many I have without defects. One of my earlier designs had an enormous defect rate (over 50%) and another had entirely wrong colors that I didn't notice in the factory photos because of the lighting. I got replacements and still met my shipping estimate, but it really stressed me out, LOL.
I always make sure that my KS friends have first crack at any new designs, since without this community, I wouldn't have ever been able to get this endeavor started.

My cubs arrived at the inward office of exchange in New York this afternoon! I know they're probably going to spend a lot more time in Customs or wherever, but I'm just really happy and relieved that they're getting closer!
If anything happens with those fuzzy versions that you posted on your Facebook, uh...I might want to buy myself some fuzzy Sugar Cubs too, because they look so nice to touch, but for now I am so going to treasure these Kickstarter plushies.

People, did it ever crossed your mind that sometimes unexpected things happen?
They appologised so many times for the delay! Stop pushing and be patient! I am sure that they are worth waiting! It's their first project and it is totally understandable that they might not provided themselves with a back up plan in case something went wrong... We all make mistakes! Let's be good to the people that engaged themselves in this project. It's not as easy as most of you may think... ❤❤❤

I totally agree. To say that we'd get our plushies in December and then push it back to January and then fall absolutely bloody silent is really rude. How hard is it to log in to Kickstarter and post an update so we don't have to chase you down on Facebook?

I’d highly suggest if you didn’t receive your package to report the campaign. It’s simply unprofessional that we get radio silence for weeks and no updates. I’m honestly at the point where I want a refund.

@Luke Cardellino I don't know if a USB cable was supposed to be included, but you don't need one. The printer is best run by loading programs on an SD card and using the LCD controller to start prints.

Hello, I received mine previous week :)
I had the same surprise than @Luke Cardellino. If I remenber well we chose a color. Normal ?

Hey there Rose!
Excellent catch on that typo! $14 was the bookmark, not the Patches! I've now altered the price in BackerKit, which applies to everyone's orders instantly. Thanks for the heads-up! As for the Soup Pin, it should automatically be in your cart when you get to the add-ons section! If it doesn't show, please let me know and I can fix that up for you.
Have an excellent day!

I have a quick question about the bookmark. Does the bookmark have actual glitter on the metal (like the kind that can rub off and end up in all the places) or is more just like glittery metal? Thank you!
MayticksCreator
6 months ago
Hi Matt!
That's a really important question! The glitter is added to recesses in the metal in an enamel base, and then for extra safety and smoothness, these bookmarks will be finished off a clear epoxy layer on the top. That glitter shan't be going anywhere it shouldn't!
I'm going to post an update with a video showing some of my other designs manufactured through my current company so I can better demonstrate what I mean, so keep an eye out for that!

Absolutely! Once the campaign has ended and we've sent out the BackerKit surveys, you'll be able to add whatever you like to your current pledge. I'm going to add the pricing to the campaign page as it becomes available for each item so that you can add it to your pledge whenever you like, or simply wait for BackerKit and add it then!
Thank you so much for your support on this project!

Hey guys, my father got his first box yesterday and he's very pleased with it! I'm excited for the next box.
I'd imagine it's always going to be an on the fly situation when you're engaging new suppliers. I'd be interested in hearing some of the stories of the successes and the ""so this is what we learned when this blew up on us"" stories too. I backed the company because I like the idea, not just for a box of pens, so I'm interested in hearing the trials and tribulations of getting this thing off the ground.

@clive klugman the basic idea was that every backer can get just one restricted reward, but if at the end not all restricted rewards are gone we will consider some additional appreciation. So it would be great if you switch to the 45Euro reward to get all three boards. Also shipment costs consist out of a base fee and 2Euros per board. Thank you very much for your support we will do our best to deliver a great product, please stay with us!

@sigoreofwar great that you enjoy our uno335 for this particular reward we have a combo reward preproduction and massproduction run for a few Euros more you get two Uno335 and the best one the first (from the preproduction run) you get latest in October. In any case we will try to accelerate the schedule to deliver ahead of schedule. Best Regards Gerhard
