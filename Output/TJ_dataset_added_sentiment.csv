US,1.0,9500,498.0,False,False,0,domestic,"As an answer to the spontaneous and complex web of global maritime related to environmental compliance , the idea for a source of information , and ready for use was born . Below is a consolidated version of the research on the original concept which will be in this project as we expand the scope to the general public . The Maritime Environmental Hub Forming a unified central for marine environmental shipping and the associated framework linking those with a role in , or providing information . Regulation Facilitation . 7 / 22 / 2018 Overview The goal been defined as a of marine environmental to the massive maritime industry of over 90 , 000 . ( 1 ) An industry spread globally along several all of which have an impact in their own respective ways . Ranging from governance on an international level of nearly 200 , to regional maritime , to flag , down to the local port , the industry is regulated on how it may impact the environment with solid enforcement across the board . In addition to the set out directly at the shipping industry , regional environmental not only have the power to but are to protecting the marine environment by with their own specific of use . To this day the of these and how they impact the shipping industry remains with the policy and the facilitation of this information must take several to reach the proper destination . The time and effort to obtain this information can be daunting , and in many it goes missing . The solution is access to a one stop shop for marine environmental shipping . the to obtain this information , centralize it and easily facilitate it to those who need it most . The goal is to reduce unlawful , accidental and protect the marine environment . Background Ship Operation In the shipping industry , on a daily basis of all and sizes transit many different of the and the . These depend upon discharging and all of waste from their vessel in order to operate at a safe and sanitary level . Although this discharging is essential for normal ship process , these are that have an effect on the environment . It is the job of several of government to regulate these from vessel to minimize the impact . Almost all must abide by these which are and will be in the coming constantly . Each shipping company set up company in which their must follow in order to avoid heavy and from the and set forth . It is the duty and the combined effort for several each ship to maintain a level of conciseness towards these sometimes strict . It is necessary for shipboard safety to follow these discharge in a very essential manner . It is also essential for the company itself to ensure its remain in compliance as many create large to very large for the company . With this being said , since the research for these is mostly done manually , there is considerable room for error as well as the possibility of missing critical information . Both can have severe for the vessel and company . In order for a vessel to ensure they are in compliance they must rely on many . These include information from company management , with local , and research within given and reference . Normally local were upon and fully upon by shipping as the most accurate and detailed information . As the industry and advance , are more and more reluctant to rely on local . This is mostly in part due to resulting from a lack of diligence by the local , especially in non . If are a vessel it is down to the ship ’ s crew to maintain and manage how to store this information . The task of compliant is becoming more and more complex given the ever , the various crew rotating , and the expansion of . Once all are set , there also becomes the need to ensure the vessel all on down to the minute and mile . Daily are usually in place to discuss such and , yet human error can still remain an issue . Policy Creation and Implementation In order to have the effect on environmental impact , regarding for the maritime industry start on an international level and continue down as local as specific port limit . On the top of international policy the International Maritime Organization ( ), and subsequently the Marine Environmental Protection Committee ( ), the committee of the responsible for the creation of international for the prevention of pollution from . These form 73 / 78 ; The international Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from . There are 159 of which have representation on the who meet annually to develop and agree upon these . ( 2 ) It is the responsibility of the Flag to ensure their specific cover everything under . The stated in are generally and enforced as it is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution from . These come with the highest of non - compliance , though most are well known and clearly outlined within six , each to a particular type of pollution . Annex Description Annex I for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil Annex for the control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid ( ) Annex for the prevention of Pollution by harmful in form Annex for the prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Annex V for the prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Annex for the prevention of Air Pollution from During each annual meeting many are and many new are set to come into force within the following year . The set out in are generally the most generic and with the entire industry in mind . This the from many specific for protection and leaves this for local and regional . Regional cover large or state for development and enforcement of environmental . These are usually government specific to either a country or a group of under a union such as the Union . of these include the Environmental Protection Agency ( ) from the , Maritime Safety Agency ( ), Maritime Safety Authority ( ), and the China Maritime Safety Administration ( ). Consequently a particular territory may have additional setting out their own set of and such as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( ) in the . In addition to these to environment and maritime , most or have health of government which regulate certain of vessel as well . For instance in the United , there is the United Public Health ( ), and in Brazil , . Both of which restrict certain into the under their authority . the United as an example of how multiple work by taking into account the , and the . The discharge and criteria under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( ) for all within United extending to 3 nautical from shore , . The to change the water in recreational water ( ) such as swimming , but does not allow their discharge within 12 nautical from land . Furthermore and marine ( ) such as National Marine which contain their own set of environmental . Luckily in the United the National Marine Center , the governing body which , is a sector of a administration which also maritime shipping activity ( ) and works closely with the US Maritime Administration ( ). Unfortunately this is not standard around the world and many are put into force without detailed consideration on the to the maritime or shipping industry . This leaves some room for interpretation . This interpretation usually up lying with the management of shipping and flag state . Each and every vessel must be registered to a particular flag state , however not all are under the same country as the vessel . The main purpose of a flag state administration is to ensure that all flying their flag are in compliance with international and . This safety , certification and pollution prevention . The flag state also additional for its to comply with the of the flag state as well . A United vessel will need to comply with international as well as U . S . shipping regardless the vessel ’ s location at any time . Flag are responsible to the and have their own set of regarding the and inspection of international . Many flag issue and to the shipping flying their flag in an attempt to maintain compliance throughout their . Although the main goal of a flag state is to maintain compliance on an international level , when on a local level are possible , the flag state is to react . It becomes a perpetual burden for such as flag and shipping to keep its up to date with anything more than the most general international regulation . The lower end such as sub - regional ( US State ), and port specific cover the area although usually come with the . Each particular Port Authority may impose their own environmental regulation in response to additional protection on a local level . State in the US may also include specific within state and are by the state itself . None of these would undermine international , regional or state , rather add another layer to the accumulation . Although nearly 97 % of the world ’ s are free from protection , there are almost 15 , 000 marine throughout the globe . ( 3 ) These come in various , sizes and of protection . The main goal of conservation is clear , but unfortunately some of these do not have specific clear on how they affect the operation of passing . Likewise if they do have , they are not well known and usually don ’ t come into play until a violation . This again leaves a heavy burden on shipping and vessel in how to manage their . Additionally most are not on nautical to notify of their location . This to common of compliance and unfortunately goes mostly unnoticed . Regardless of the authority all are on an international level under in the . With so much of the open ocean which under no particular jurisdiction ( 60 %), the UN are taking towards protecting this region under a high - treaty . This treaty will delegate the for designation , , and enforcement of marine on the high . Facilitation of this information is key , especially to those crossing , operating commercial , and calling the sea home . Under the of the regulatory pyramid fall shipping company specific policy . Company policy normally goes above and beyond set out by international , flag state and regional . This smooth of covering most and around the world . Although this may seem a particularly simple task , there is a need for intense and constant collaboration due to two major . The first is the ever industry and the consistency of constant collaboration . The second factor is related to the effect these have on shipboard . In general limiting shipboard can be critical to the safety , efficiency , timing and overall success of a voyage . a clear and distinct line between protecting the environment and limiting shipboard is of the upmost importance for any shipping company . In short , by doing too little a company , a bad reputation and a degree of certainty that will not allow them to compete in the future as advance . By doing too much , the company expensive overhead , time , overall risk to voyage efficiency , and the need of additional for management . Regardless of the company policy , the shipping themselves are also the first level of enforcement for any regulation no matter the designation level .

This remains constant down to sub - regional / port where as previously , the of sub - regional and local port have sufficient of inspection and enforcement .

Distance and alarm alone assist in the normal operation of the vessel , although without the core the unit is operating at limited capacity . The unit is the of passing the vital regulatory information directly into the bitter end . In order to complete this objective , the must be built . The data will come from several among various of management and designation . This will ensure the most comprehensive environmental compliance tool possible .

But to truly make this dream a reality , we need your help . WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Q : Who are & Traps ? A : We are a new - based , non - profit , repertory company made up of , , , , film , , and - a diverse group of people with a vast array of different and experience , all united in our passion for re - classic for modern . Our past work two critically of Much Ado About Nothing and The Winter ' s Tale in 2014 at the Lion and Unicorn , and our next production is an epically gory in 2015 , but we ' re not limited to solely . We have several such as the master of the lexicon , actor and presenter Brandreth , as well as Award - winning West End actor . Put simply , our mandate is to put on the best night ' s live you can get for under £ 20 . We take an old tale , and we tell it in a way you ' never seen before . Our work is bold , it ' s unusual , it ' s unafraid of taking . We ' had a phenomenal first year , and cannot wait to show you what we ' got next with Shrew . "" Exit by a bear "" - The Winter ' s Tale 2014 Q : What ' s so different about your production of Of The Shrew ? A : One of the main that our show unique is that it is staged as a play within a play , where the and are in a full cast gender inversion ; which every single character in the story to be completely re - from scratch . This is not the Shrew you know . It will draw you into a world run by a matriarchy , where sons are sold off by their to the highest bidder , where are dragged off screaming by their ; a world where make the big , and their men must live with the . This , for us , is our biggest excitement - as it will allow our access to that they would never normally get to play , and as a team we will discover how this a tale we all think we know . It ' s a love story of , running from a world of and , Shrew is often "" a battle of the "", but we are interested in what to that battle when the tables are turned . - Nominated Actress as in The Winter ' s Tale ( 2014 ) Q : Why did you choose to switch around ? A : We certainly ' t take this decision lightly , and see it as far more than just a gimmick . First of all , and this is quite important if you want your play to be entertaining ( which we do ), when you turn the Shrew ( ) into a man , and her tamer ( ) into a woman , you instantly inject back some of the fierce humour that originally intended , which modern struggle to find sometimes . But more than this , we find out what when you take a story of female powerlessness and male dominance , and flip it completely on its head . Is it still cruel ? Is it still a love story ? Is it worse now that a woman is doing the ? Is it more palatable now that the victim is a man ? We want to explore male helplessness , to question what would make a man be by society as "" shrewish "", and how would a conservative and oppressive society resolve that . We want to find out what a female society is like when it ' t had to deal with male validation . We even want to explore the issue of a particular form of domestic violence that is often or , namely when it is a man who is the victim . We want to find out whether love can survive in a world that is revolving about wealth and worth , and how truly you can ever really know another person when everyone around you is to be someone else . In short , we want to give the Shrew back its teeth . Much Ado About Nothing ( 2014 ) Q : Is it still ? A : Absolutely . The text is a slightly cut - down version of the original , running at just over 90 . ' s are still here ( except for his of of course ), and we want , above all , to stay true to his . But we think this is a version of the story that he would have of . He was an adaptor , he took well - known and , and he made them his own . We think he wrote to make people think about the world they lived in , to question whether love can ever triumph over all , to investigate how much we are defined by our ' of us , to argue over whether a true rebel ' s heart can ever truly be , or rather is it only when it is understood ? This is a play that to create debate with , and we think somewhere along the line our collective modern have blocked our to this . The only way then is re - invent it to the point where we can experience it again like new . Q : Where does my money go ? A : There are no fat full in our production company . We do this for the love . We work in day , teach , wait tables , give out , drink too much coffee , have fever about lost props or forgotten , think constantly about , and never want to change a single minute of it . Anything you give will go directly into making the show happen . It will buy for our leading ladies , props for our , an hour ' s rental of a rehearsal studio ; every single penny will be driven straight back into making this our best show yet . The heart of our production are our , we ' d be nowhere without them , so a large portion of any we receive will go towards a fair and honest wage for their of hard work . And we ' re not talking of a day and their own trailer filled with blue M & here , we ' re talking about the basic minimum wage in the .

US,1.0,50000,51841.63,True,True,1,domestic,"( , please read on below this paragraph . 。 Sie . . pour . para . per l ' . pro . ide . . para o .) Hi ! I ' m . I maintain ten different add - ons for the Thunderbird , and I need your help to be able to keep doing that . If you use any of my add - ons and you want to keep them past 2020 , please read on ! Thunderbird is a great application , but sometimes people want it to do differently , either because they have a different vision for how the should behave , or because it ' s impossible for the who maintain Thunderbird to include every feature that anyone . That ' s where add - ons come in . The first add - on I , nearly a decade ago , was Send Later . Send Later to write now and schedule them to be later , either just once or on a schedule . I to be able to do that , but the original author of Send Later was no longer it and it was no longer working , so I took on the challenge of fixing it . Since Send Later , I ' either written from scratch or taken over maintenance of eleven other add - ons , nine of which ( Folder Pane View Switcher , Show All Body , Received Date , Enhanced Priority Display , Reply to Multiple , Toggle , , , and Remote Content By Folder ), are still active . All my add - ons have always been entirely free . Although I ' accepted to support development of some of my add - ons , those have always been entirely voluntary , and most do not donate . Up until about a year ago , the code within Thunderbird that add - ons was pretty stable , so the effort to keep add - ons working was minimal . However , about a year ago , the of Thunderbird start down a path of which force add - on to rewrite all of their add - ons before the release of Thunderbird 78 , which is currently for June 2020 . Those before the release of Thunderbird 68 in August 2019 . Although it was difficult , I was able to fix most of my add - ons for compatibility with Thunderbird 68 , and therefore most of my have been able to continue them as they ' switched to the new Thunderbird version . However , the coming in Thunderbird 78 are much more extensive , and I will need to do a lot more work on my add - ons for Thunderbird 78 than I did for 68 . It ' s simply too much work for me to sustain to do it for just voluntary . Therefore , I have made the difficult decision to switch to a subscription model for my add - ons . Once Thunderbird 78 is , my add - ons will require to use , priced as : $ 5 per year per user for a single add - on $ 10 per year per user for three add - ons $ 25 per year per user for all add - ons $ 50 for a perpetual license for one user for all add - ons I ' this campaign because I can ' t proceed unless about 10 % of my add - ons ' current commit in advance to keep and paying for them . Otherwise , I ' m afraid when Thunderbird 78 is my add - ons will stop working , except for the that someone else forward and to take over and update . And you know what ? It would be awesome if someone else took over my add - ons and continued to maintain them for free , just as I took over Send Later ago . I love and believe in free , so that would actually be the ideal outcome as far as I ' m concerned . I ' tried to find people to do that , but so far I ' been unsuccessful . As far as I ' m concerned , switching to a model like this is actually the lesser of two ; it ' s either this or abandon my add - ons completely and leave all of my in the lurch , which I ' d really rather not do if I can avoid it . This campaign may actually help me find people willing to take over my add - ons and maintain them for free . If this campaign , and some of my add - ons do get adopted by new , then I ' pay them from the proceeds of the campaign . that on offer may help me attract new for my add - ons , so you may get to keep the add - ons for free even after the I ' m offering in this campaign would have .","[' Can I support you and get one of the without on the site ? If for whatever reason you are unwilling or unable to pledge on the site , then you can me at @ . us and tell me how much you would like to pledge , and then if they campaign I will arrange payment with you separately and give you the reward corresponding to your pledge amount . However , please think twice before doing this , because such a pledge will not count toward the campaign total on , and I will not be able to proceed with my add - ons to Thunderbird 78 unless the campaign on its goal .

Remember that if I am not taking in enough license revenue , then the add - ons will not be sustainable and I \' have to stop , so please play fair . , 23 2020 7 : 58 If I \' m a previous donor to your add - ons , do I have to donate again to the to get a license ? Previous to my add - ons get a separate , special deal ! I \' most of my previous already , but some have since they donated , and I might have a few .

Note that the previous - donor and "" stack ,"" so you \' still come out ahead . , 23 2020 7 : 58 Are your add - ons going to remain open - source ? ; I am not sure it will be feasible for the add - ons to remain open - source , but if it is then they will . I have been add - ons for nearly a decade , and in that time , less than 2 % of the people them have to support them . Given the extent and frequency of recent Thunderbird significant to add - ons , that level of financial support is no longer sustainable for me . I tried to solve that , before this campaign , by finding to help with the add - ons , but none stepped forward . I even to give someone all of the received for the add - ons for the next year , and 50 % for five after that , and still , no one was willing to do it . I \' therefore reluctantly that the only way I can sustain to maintain the add - ons is if I can guarantee significantly higher recurring revenue than the voluntary . That is why I am a campaign : the campaign will not succeed unless enough people commit , and it \' s that commitment that I need to be able to continue . If I keep the add - ons open - source after doing the work to port them to Thunderbird 78 , then anyone will be able to take the source code , remove the code , and repost them as different add - ons on . thunderbird . net , undercutting what I am trying to do here and us back to it being impossible for me to sustain to maintain them . Even now , when this campaign of and of , if a qualified person stepped forward and to take over maintenance and port the add - ons to Thunderbird 78 , I would cancel the campaign and keep the add - ons free and open source . My goal here \' t to rake in cash , it \' s to make it possible for the add - ons to continue to exist , and I have a strong preference for open source when it is viable . But it \' t viable if no one is willing and able to keep the add - ons for free . One caveat : if the campaign , then I will look into the possibility of making the code open - source under copyright which it from being used to compete with the licensed add - ons . I would love to do that if it turns out to be possible . However , I am not sure it will be , because I fear I will end up spending the time and money that was supposed to be spent the add - ons instead on suing people the copyright .

GB,1.38216428,2000,3314.0,True,False,1,domestic,"Overview The is a simple interface board for your Raspberry Pi Zero or . The time in is spelt out on an 8 by 8 letter matrix , with accuracy an on - board battery backed real time clock chip . Although the base will be the language version pictured I will also include and s / w [ via ] for a Dutch and version - See the more information . Interested , but trouble getting a Pi Zero - then start with a . It is easy to change this out later on , just unplug the and plug in your Pi Zero . You can also use the with any of the other Raspberry Pi - there is more detail on this in the following section . Design Evolution The clock out as a project for a Pi Zero I had just received . got a lot attention from my original post , I decided to work it up to launch as a , essentially to fund a production run of . While working the layout for the I it would be quite easy to incorporate the option to run the clock from an . So spent a bit of time it to check there were no with the and display driver , then added a as an alternative processor option onto the layout . Finally in the spirit of flexibility I added extra drilling ' s so you can , with relative ease also mount a Raspberry Pi A / B onto the back of the board and then wire them it in individual . The only Pi ' s I haven ' t for are the very early without any fixing . These will still drive the board but you will have to figure out your own mounting . The guess is that most people wanting to support the will opt for the kit reward level , but I have included 2 additional ' ready built ' - one which is ready and one which will include a - clone . The are limited so please don ' t wait too long to pledge if interested . Functionality The word clock the time the ' 12 hour ' format in spelt out on an 8 by 8 letter matrix , time is displayed in 5 minute [ 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ...]. The correct time is when the unit is not powered by an on - board battery backed chip . With an 8 x 8 matrix there obviously have to be some , for instance ' HALF ' and ' TWO '; Even with the of an 8x8 matrix you can display time to a + / - 3 minute accuracy . Three rear mounted allow the time to set and as . will also be included on how to optionally set the time via a connected . In normal operation the does not need to be connected to the or a host computer . Pledge reward include kit an built of the clock , For an example of the detail that will be included in the for the kit version follow this link to the Pi - build , my last . Technical Description The finished printed circuit board size will be about 112mm x 70mm , it could have been little shorter but with these the length to width ratio works out to 1 . 6 which is often to a ' Golden Triangle ' - considered by many and to be the most aesthetically pleasing form of a rectangle , so I decided to stick with it . With the exception of the display and Pi Zero / most other are mounted on the rear of the board , - Pi / could have gone on the back but why hide a thing of beauty ! Hardware Display - 60x60mm red No surface mount on the board , so should not be to solder with a basic level of competence Raspberry Pi interface , compatible with old and new Pi ' s as it only the first 26 header Power for the board is via Pi ' s micro connector or for the it ' s - B connector [ note and are not with any of the pledge ] The real time clock ( ) is battery backed with CR1220 coil cell , [ because of postage the battery is not included in any of the pledge ] There are 3 monetary , these are used to allow the clock to be set and to shut the Pi down cleanly when not connected to a host computer The Letter Matrix To keep down I am NOT to commission a custom acrylic overlay , to date I have found laser printed to work fine , this also you the opportunity to experiment with different . I will include a few - printed in the as well as providing on - line . for the Dutch and will be included with the pledge Python code will be available for down load via for Raspberry Pi setup and as a sketch for the between prototype and final production version Slightly smaller [ 112 / 70mm ] The 3 will be rear mounted and to low profile Most with the exception of the Pi / will be rear mounted will be included in the to give the option not to solder the / Pi Zero directly in - with the I think it is actually easier to solder it directly as you only need to solder used not all 40 ! The will be incorporated directly onto the rather than as separate daughter board The power on indicator LED will not be included as both the Pi and have on - board power Current Design Development Status The design is at the working prototype stage , as you can see from the main project picture , the work and design are detailed in the following bullet What ’ s been accomplished so far The hardware design is complete I have multiple for all the Pi and hardware been on and tested The layout is complete and tested The for the Raspberry Pi version been running on the prototype for over a month now , but I will tidy it up a little mainly to improve the . The still needs some work but I have tested all the functional together . Currently I am less than 30 % of the ' s memory this will grow slightly but I do not envisage any capacity Proto - type Dutch and version are up and running What work remains to be done I have now received and tested the prototype against a Pi and . This me to check the layout and importantly confirm the mechanical are correct . I am will be going through a second prototype cycle which is for in the overall reward delivery plan . From the perspective there is no no significant development work to do so I plan to wait until the prototype are available and then complete the . Educational One of the of the is to be able to offer the as a sensibly priced kit for and electronics . This could range from a basic kit build to learn / improve soldering , to providing with a ready build card without a processor and then them to research and select a suitable processor card . This would be a good example of an abstraction process to a real world problem [ part of the key stage 3 curriculum ]. One point I took away from a recent chat with a teacher is offering part built , to make the more accessible to / with more limited soldering .

They can take a beating , thanks to their heavy armor and , all the while keeping the focus of the fight on themselves through a variety of threatening and taunting tactics . Tide are a combination melee damage and support class . Typically at home in the fray , Tide deal devastating damage with large two - handed and boost their allies ' through inspiration .

We have so much news and activity to share with you and will be in the next few days . Today , I can reveal that we are absolutely delighted to be in this year ' s Festival . This will be our first performance of Giving Up and we are so excited to be included in this incredible festival , a great platform for this work . As we are down to the final few of crowd - here , I ' m not stretch , but the more we can invest in marketing the play and the potential to live stream a performance , so more people see it , will cost . So forgive me , not the , as I ' t sure today would happen or not , but we are a creative team of eight people and this campaign was always to support the start of this project . We have grant to go . Thank you so very much for making this happen . We still have some lovely to offer anyone who would like to pledge today . THANK YOU !! Team WHY I WROTE THE PLAY I am adopted and was with my birth family many ago . Every I have ever seen on television , film and to a lesser extent stage ( if , at all ), never one ounce of truth for me . I am not alone . We received an Council grant last year to research and develop the play . We to Coram ( adoption charity ) - the response was overwhelming with so many adopted people and associated with adoption grateful for a play that spoke a truth ! The play , like most of my writing , a humorous touch . You ' t get through this subject without it . I have written the play to encourage people to think about adoption , specifically reunion which rarely the ending , so often in media and . But the play is also not without hope , love , and reaffirmation . Now , I want to bring to the stage with an amazingly talented creative team , a story that and is respectful to everyone connected with adoption . The play also to a audience and the within the play are just as relevant to non - adopted . This is a universal play and one we really want to share with you ! ( Note : all are taken from our audience at Coram , Plough Roundabout and Soho ). ( ) & ( ) WHY DOES THIS PLAY MATTER ...? We want to challenge the and about adoption and we believe it ' s time for an authentic voice on the subject . We believe is the most powerful way to tell this story . It can act as a catalyst for change and influence legislation to improve anyone ' s life affected by adoption . ' I found the play very powerful , I my daughter when I at Coram to say I was nervous , the message back said ‘ Mummy , I ’ m of you , this is your world .’ So right '. ( ) & Leighton ( KIT ) IS IT JUST FOR ADOPTED PEOPLE ....? No . It ' s for everyone . In our R & D we produced for adoption and non - adoption at Coram , Soho and Plough Roundabout . It was partly to see if the play worked beyond the adoption community and , to our delight , it was received with equal enthusiasm . In every family , whether adopted or non - adopted there is a dynamic , a tension , love and curiosity ; it ' s not unique to adoption , it ' s part of our human experience . Giving up is a story for everyone . ' ' s journey is really a of and . The character is extremely relatable even for an audience member who not experienced adoption .' - DIRECTOR - - PLAYWRIGHT THE TOUR Spring 2020 This will be our first tour of ten to and non in the South East region . We want to extend our audience reach and provide accessible . Our charity performance will be with Coram ( ) and open to and the general public . Each venue will be a facilitator led post - show discussion and drama ( subject to ) exploring of identity , connection , displacement and the myriad of that adoption up . We will also be offering a Intern position for a young person who been in the care system who is interested in forging out a career in professional . ' to all ! I ’ m looking forward to seeing this play in its entirety . It ’ s not an issue that ’ s covered in this way very often . and was the last thing I can connect this topic to and I feel this whole area of adoption needs more of this kind of intelligent and truthful exploration and discussion '. Nelson ( ) THE FUTURE This tour will leverage us into a position to secure production support , work with an established producer , capital to tour the , link internationally , primarily with the who have a very different adoption system to the . We will invite international to consider an exchange with us , to share and learn more about each other ' s cultural , political and social of adoption . are to a long - term involvement with the adoption community , providing valuable , panel speaker involvement , and a future book from the playwright about her own adoption reunion story . ' Anything that adoption is good thing '. WHERE YOU MAKE THE DIFFERENCE Our are a significant part of this journey . It ' s your support that can allow this production to happen . We ' d love you to be a part of the difference we truly believe this play can make . We hope you can come and see the play , and meet us , we ' d love to say thank you in person . If this campaign is successfully funded , it we can guarantee the play on ! This would contribute to a vast chunk of our artistic spending budget , meaning we can pay the and crew to produce the show . We are in the process of which would allow us to expand upon the tour listed .

The goal is to bring them to a level of refinement and finish seen it the bottom row , and prepare . - suitable for use by other & . Alright , who ' s responsible for this ? I ' m , a lifelong designer & scribble explorer . I first came to art as a of realizing & — only to discover that art could be a tool for . The pursuit of & imagery — and art that aid it — kept me busy for a few ( starting long before I ever touched a computer ). Here ' s my informal / . An Agile Old Pioneer … at least I like to think so — regarding the agile bit — nothing I can do about the old part . My first professional , digital & 3D content date back to the mid 80 ' s — 3D Content for the ST & Antic ' s Cad3D ( Cad 3D soon after into 3D Studio , and 3D Studio ). However , there is nothing nostalgic or legacy about the works in this project . While certainly drawing on my of work and play with 3D design , these are all recent works . Toolmaker I my first Digital Art ( perhaps a stretch to call them ' Graphics ') in the early 80 ' s — first 3D were part of the original 3D Studio plug - — around 1990 . My current , ongoing graphics tool project is — a unique and playful / artistic tool for designing & 3D . was the primary tool used for all of the in this project . Why not ? Why do I want to give away this original intellectual property ? Because I ' m mortal , and the work need not be . Because — try ' tho i might — I can ' t work 100 a week . Because of a lifetime subscription to the idea of artistic collaboration . There is no way I ' ever realize the full potential of this work . It ' s a wonderful property of digital art — especially 3D — that once the modeling is done , countless can be derived . , lighting , scene creation , additional modeling , inclusion in other 3D , animation — all lead to new works . Even if I had infinite time and energy , solo development of the work would never be as rich and varied as the collaborative . It would be a waste to leave this work languishing in virtual ( my hard & ) — with just a smattering of , scattered across the web , being the extent of their potential . Getting this work into the of other , & that foolishness . The work ' s value is in the , imagination and love put into each piece . The value is in its potential . That value is best extracted by freely the work and inviting other creative people to explore , expand & enhance it . Why ? I need help . , the primary tool used in the creation of all of the in this project , eats up much of my time these days . I will personally do the creative work to get the ready for release , but there are big technical , and small administrative , that need doing as well . will not be paying for the original work - to - date ( which to 1000 ' s of ).

Hi , Thanks for the feedback . Nice to see another owner / artist here . We will release several very quickly after is . However , there are only a few that are ready for release . For most , significant work is to get each one ready . That is , naturally , the purpose of the project ... to support the work to prepare each model for release . It ' s vital to refine and organize the so that each is truly useful to other . I would not want to simply dump all of this work — in its raw creatively - state — out there in the world . That would likely lead to and frustration for those to use the work . If the work was ready for distribution , there would be no real need for this project . That said , we will do everything possible to release the quickly — I was perhaps a bit conservative in my projection of the pace , but to insure that I was enough time to release quality . About your suggestion for ' with more digital ' -- what were you to see ? More Concept Art , or was that part of your notion about in the ?

Seven days only Choose a and get a Uno8266 FOR FREE !!! -------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 15 . 06 . 15 : We are featured at and UPDATE 12 . 06 . 15 : Added additional material to scroll down to Use for type control of high voltage --- Original Start --- When reading our name did you think just another copy of something famous ? Hold on , yes we might have not been very creative with our name , but believe it , we are very creative with our hard and . We just did not spend much more time with the name to have more time for development . Were do we come from ... from different in the semiconductor industry we meet by chance the and quickly it is a great tool for a lot of . One thing we in our work is : We frequently for not 5V I / O but 3 . 3V and therefor a level shifter . Also is a bit tight when you want to store lots of sensor data . So we decided to make our own version to add this . Of course the easy approach could have been to run simply from 3 . 3V but that would have been not perfect either , as there are also other e . g . like a lot of gas 5V and in addition we would have lost speed . We call this board Uno335 to point to the . As we were working ( and hearing of the cool ESP8266 with ), we thought why always use a Raspberry for the gateway plan a shield to cover not very complex stuff . No sooner said than done our designer the first prototype . This board will be Uno8266 as it is a shield with footprint and a 8266 module . After two we thought further and the idea to add a sensor board for environmental of temperature , humidity , pressure , various and a ( optional ) CO2 sensor . The gas and especially the CO2 sensor will be optional as a good CO2 sensor is more expensive than all the rest of the we want to make . Now we covered , connectivity and so what is missing ? Yes you are right ! A actuator ! We to work on a power plug with an power supply . The great thing is that by providing a small voltage 3 - 30Vdc so you can use the the supply to power Uno335 / Uno8266 / and use a digital output to switch . Guess you got the idea ... To us ( and hopefully you as well ) that will be helpful so we stood up funded a company and prepared this project . Again , given our mostly technical focus the are not very creative , or do you think different ? But now apart , look on the great specs . The Specs The technical Uno335 The Uno335 is built based on an R3 and all the basic that you love , the completely same . Indeed you can use your Uno335 exactly as the original by setting , but this is not the mode we have made the Uno335 for . Given the point above the Uno335 is the IDE . here . We added 512kbit serial to increase storage capacity . This memory will connect to the the interface . A library will be provided to access the serial . I2C at 3 . 3V as many just work based on 3 . 3V I / O we added the classical circuit for I2C at , close to . On A4 , A5 still the regular 5V I2C interface is available , you can use I2C at both voltage . Setting you can switch of the . at 3 . 3V we added a TI TXB0104 bidirectional to the digital 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 the interface at 3 . 3V . As the serial is running on 3 . 3V as well , it the same . To keep digital pin 10 ( slave select ) for external use we have a voltage divider on pin that can act as slave select for the internal serial . Also these can be / disabled . Uno8266 ESP8266 - 12 module antenna shield either or through the for IDE . Can be wirelessly card socket . Board is designed for dual use either as shield on top of a Uno335 or powered by the ESP8266 in . We will see if it works on top of standard as well . Voltage converter to 3 . 3V LM3671 ( buck converter 1A output ) 74LVC1T45 ( for Uno335 ) Interface : ATmega328 running at 3 . 3V the IDE BME280 ( pressure , temp , humidity ) connected with I2C LTR303ALS01 ( ambient light sensor ) connected with I2C ML8511 ( light sensor ) out connect to ATmega328 TSSP58038 remote control ( Receiver ) VSMB10940 remote control ( Sender ) Supply voltage 5V from Uno335 V voltage converter to 3 . 3V LP2985 4 ( 2x I2C , 1x , 1x digital ) to Grove , this way you can add more than 100 additional and other useful . CO2 ( near absorption based ) sensor optional We consider the CO2 sensor very important as this gas no color and does not smell and even at only slightly higher (> 600ppm to the typical 350 - 450ppm ) you start to feel not perfect . To action you first need to the CO2 level and here the EE893 sensor can be mounted on the prepared comes in . Key E + E dual CO2 working principle Measuring range up to 10 , 000ppm Auto - calibration for excellent long term stability Temperature compensation Highly insensitive to pollution Very low current consumption down to 60 Digital output Very small size Comes from . You can find more here . The only reason why we have made it optional is , is it very expensive to the of the ( roughly about 3 times the price of a ). You can think of combining especially the to do something against high CO2 level ( e . g . turn fresh air supply on ).

I understand where your critique is coming from , but please let me explain a little bit of my thought process behind the you : The choice to not include any text other than the poem at the beginning was a very deliberate one – I see as a visual poem that through imagery and not . Personally , I feel like the introductory poem the tone for the following without imposing too much on the and them to make their own about the project . The purpose of the was not to just showcase the of the series , it was to be the project itself , which is why I the whole design as if I was designing an exhibition – around with different image sizes , order and negative space . As the themselves are already very dense it was important for me to give them room to breathe , hence the admittedly generous use of negative space . I feel like the - format for a much less traditional and more experimental approach to design than a conventional . This is also the reason why some of the I ’ decided to show are rather tiny – it was important for them to work within the visual context they are . The design itself went through various which involved a lot of dummy in order to come to the vision I had in my head for this project . To be honest , this was my very first foray into crowd - and after reading your I realize that I maybe should have given a little more background information on the project page in order to avoid people to get something that I never intended to create . I ’ been working on this project intensely for such a long time so it was admittedly difficult to step outside my own head and look at the project with a neutral pair of .

The screen printed banderole was a nice touch and great over the cover . I love how well this been printed onto top quality paper stock at really high . A couple of I found a bit odd ... I there to be some writing in there explaining your further and telling the reader what was going through your mind at the time of capture . Even some would of been nice . Going through it was like reading through a magazine that had all the text missing from it . Your work is and complex and would of from some writing or something to fill those big white . Instead there is a LOT of blank and even whole been left blank . If you had decided not to add any writing to accompany your work then you should of maybe used those blank and to give the smaller a size or even add them to their own page and blow them up to full A5 size . Failing that then you could of added more art . Personally I think you really a trick by leaving all that beautiful paper blank by not filling it with text or used it better to display your work in much scale as some of the are tiny and would of great if taken up to a size . Its a real waste of that lovely paper . I buy and read / go through of of all , and sizes . I have to say that for a costing € 15 and such beautiful paper and lavish decoration that I did feel it was a bit of a let down . The are fantastic and I did really enjoy them and got them , but were not given their full glory by you choosing to only print them in such small scale leaving and worth of that paper blank . Just some and a few would of the experience greatly . I have a bunch of similar photography and and they mostly all make use of ever square inch of paper , even if just printed on cheap 60gsm paper . and would kill to have the money to produce a on such nice paper with a great cover and screen printed surround and I know they would try to get as much of it filled ... especially where bigger is better ( where as written and mainly text can become too crowded easily ).

US,1.0,15000,1427.0,False,True,0,domestic,"Herpetological Exploration and Research Team ( H . E . A . R . T .) A male and a female golden toad , showing sexual dimorphic coloration . The Project : The Golden Toad , was a unique Costa amphibian that was thoroughly studied from 1964 – 1988 . In 1989 it ’ s population suddenly , and by 1990 it was feared extinct . While it was never clear exactly what its obvious decline , the Golden Toad and it ’ s story the poster child for Amphibian world - wide and modern extinction in general . We feel that while the case of the Golden Toad received a huge amount of attention , there was never a attempt to rediscover it within its original range , or to search for other nearby where it may have better than within its known range . and can be notoriously difficult to locate , and when they inhabit montane they tend to have disjunct and scattered . Our goal with this project is to check the historical of this toad during its active breeding season , as well as look for it in new potential which we have already assessed via earth . If we are able to rediscover this species , it will help to raise awareness about the demise of around the world , but also to call attention to the fact that for many species which would appear to be extinct , their remains a glimmer of hope . This is a search and recover mission , to check every possible Golden Toad habitat still intact in the and to determine whether our are correct , and that the toad is still around in the cloud in the spring . WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO COLLECT THIS TOAD , ONLY TO VERIFY ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE AND PROVE IT WITH AND OBSERVATION DATA . We will not be any specimen on this expedition , only with , video & audio . The infamous male Golden Toad , in all its splendor . The Toad : The Golden Toad , , is a small Costa amphibian first discovered by in 1964 in a stunted montane cloud forest huddling the continental divide . Immediately upon discovery , the knew they had found something special . The one and half to two inch toad remarkable difference between and . While possessed a blackish or greenish ground color with red and white , the were unicolor bright traffic cone orange . The golden toad an explosive breeding behavior , which took place when the weather in Costa from the winter "" dry season "" to the summer "" rainy season "". The would only breed right after the first couple had fallen , but before the forest saturated . These breeding rarely more than four or five days , & afterward the would disappear for the rest of the year . The toad ' s unique appearance , coupled with its extremely unique breeding , made it a favorite study subject for working with Costa , yet very little is know about these outside of their brief appearance to bread . When the Golden were extent , they formed large breeding where many would try to breed one female . Golden Toad Habitat , Reserve , Costa . The Story : In 1987 working with the Golden Toad , as well as different amphibian species around the world , a drop in . The drop of the in was especially alarming , because the habitat was intact and to have no negative human . However , the drop in these toad ' s population was one of the most extreme , to the degree that approximately 1500 were seen in 1987 , however only 10 were seen in 1988 , one in 1989 and from then on no were . Since the early 1990s , undoubtedly no scientist seen this frog in the wild . It was officially declared extinct in 2004 , after more than 15 of not been seen anywhere . Due to its unique appearance , and rapid extinction , the Golden Toad quickly rose to be the poster child of amphibian , and also to raise awareness about extinction in general . Stunted Cloud Forest along the Continental Ridge with heavy epiphyte growth . The Plan : With recent of various previously thought to be extinct , we have decided to organize a effort to rediscover the Golden Toad , in Costa , in 2014 . We plan on taking with us four , from the and , and sample at least five different during 5 of the breeding period of the Golden Toad , which in late March and into early May . The to be will include two of the historic Golden Toad , where they were common before their extinction , as well as over a half a dozen potential . The potential we have chosen share similar as far as habitat , vegetation , elevation and rainfall go , which are the main for where a species can or can not occur . Our goal is to check each site at least once every three days , in order to not miss even the breeding episode should it occur during the time we are there . When there is rainfall & necessary for breeding to occur , we will focus on the “ historic ”, afterwards we will scour the “ potential ” for and , which would be evidence of on - going breeding which we may have . Map of Reserve . Red are original toad , Orange are we suspect will have , based on elevation , rainfall and habitat . The Team : Our team spent the last twelve actively searching out new species or of species of tropical and throughout . We have also worked on several or species which have thought to be extinct . Among these we have specifically worked with venomous and explosive breeding . We have been lucky enough to rediscover the Long - tailed Rattlesnake in 2008 , which had been considered extinct since 1966 . We also of the Sheep Frog in in 2002 , the Montane in in 2007 , and the ' s Palm in the Selva region of in 2013 . We have discovered approximately seven new species of frog of the genus , scattered throughout , , Colima and , as well as at least one new species of rattlesnake in the of , , and .

When the guest walk in they will walk in to a light reception that is going on almost like a meet and greet . The ceremony will start 45 into the event once everyone . The Ceremony The event will have a very dramatic ceremony with a twist . Since it is a fake wedding I think it is only right for it to have a theatrical side to it . One way this theatrical side will be will be in the wedding party . Everyone a part of the wedding party will be random people that have never met before . For example the best man , and the , the maid of honor , and maid , even down to the of the bride and groom . When I market the event I will market it the first 50 people to purchase will qualify to have a role in the wedding . The more serious like the groom , bride , and priest will be by actual just for the sake of the show going as comically smooth as possible . While the ceremony is happening there will be a plot twist , for example the groom may never show up and the bride the priest or maybe the maid of honor is in love with the groom and she up about her at the alter . The married couple will be ( Whoever up getting married ) So many potential plot twist just to keep it funny and fun . After the ceremony the actual reception will start and there will be a bride and groom first dance , a toast and speech by the best man and maid of honor , cake cutting , father daughter dance , mother son dance , more and of course no wedding is complete without the garter and bouquet toss . ( Each one will have a twist in some way ) This amazing event will offer every single thing any other wedding to offer except "" "" What will the funds go towards ? $ 2 , 000 will go towards the that it is in the center of downtown Little Rock , $ 2 , 000 will go towards the experience that over 3000 in his career . $ 1 , 500 will go towards marketing ; , Social Media , and Radio Advertisement .

This May , I will be walking this pilgrimage alone in order to work towards breaking down the stigma around mental health . On the , people are walking ( sometimes alone ) for a month or more . They become very self reflective . I plan to tap into this introspection and inquire as to people ’ s regarding mental health . I believe that because the people I meet will be especially aware of themselves , they will have some very interesting to say . My hope is that by many people ’ s and them with you , we will all come to a better understanding of what mental health is and how to overcome we may face .

Several are and supporting this project in various ways . More information will be available soon as to who is involved . Another aspect of this project the reason why I ended up dropping out of school last year . I was suffering from social anxiety which led to depression . My social anxiety was highly specific to the particular situation of meeting new people for the first time . After seeking help and going through therapy , I was able to overcome this challenge and I am now ready to use my as a testament to the benefit of getting help . On the I will be walking alone and will be meeting new people multiple times a day . I will use this opportunity of meeting new people to ask them about their concerning mental health and take their photo .

All the design and and testing is complete , now we just need to put in our order and start into the of every violin player who to plug in , get down and rock out . The Violin Almost As Good As It What Do I Plug into ? We recommend the Fender Mustang 1 Amplifier . Why a Fender Mustang 1 amplifier ? Even a high - priced electric violin will sound scratchy and irritating through a standard guitar . Professional typically run directly through the PA system . A small Fender Mustang 1 can be - for the violin . We will show you how it ’ s done . Although the Mustang 1 is small and not very powerful , you can place it behind you as your monitor speaker , and in a band situation , you can drape a microphone over the front to send sound to the PA . ( We like the inexpensive Samson R - 11 microphone that ’ t pick up as much white noise as a high - fidelity .) Can you play a Violin unplugged ? Yes . Although the instrument unplugged is not as loud as a high - priced , finely - violin , it still a great sound . What do you mean by “ spatial awareness ?” Jazz use the term “ frame shifting ” to describe the technique of melodic in upper , i . e . without open . For example , if you look at the diagram below you see a diagram of a fretted violin neck with five natural that begin on E . Those scales can be to any other location on the neck and have the same relative sound . The violinist does not even have to compute the key signature of the new location . The Violin Can Help You Discover A New Sense of Spatial Awareness Tell Me About the … The Fiddle Fretter we use real , not just marker . Like those tied onto a viola da gamba , the on a Fiddle Fretter are thin nylon string that you can barely feel . As seen in the video clip of Ben Dean , you can slide above the for a true glissando . Beyond that , the provide a distinct advantage when “ frame shifting ” or rhythmic double – that are extremely useful when “ alternative .” Can you be as expressive with on a violin ? Yes . Unlike the guitar that becomes mute when you release pressure in your left hand , the violin does not . You can play with vibrato , but also choose not to and still play in tune . What if I want an violin without ? No problem . We first recommend that you use the Violin in several for a month or two . Especially when in a group with or , you will find that you are more relaxed with . You will find that you can play with much less vibrato . If , at the end of two , you still want an violin without , you can remove the Fiddle Fretter leaving no trace that it was ever there .",[' '],0,No yet .,0.0,30,Music,World Music,6,2014,"The ™ Violin : A Low Cost , Great Sounding Electric Violin .

After the review been posted , an will be sent to the builder if they would like to comment on anything the review said . This way each side to state their story . will also be able to comment on the to ensure every voice is . A home purchase is most likely the biggest financial decision some can make . The more informed the easier the decision comes . Home Screen Example Builder Profile Example Example The reason behind the why ? If you have ever built a house or know someone who , are they to pull their hair out on multiple . This is typical ; however , what ’ s not typical is getting the legal process involved because the builder is doing anything they can to cut . I want to give future a better explanation of what to look out for when choosing a builder and hopefully save people from losing their entire life ' s ( as you will read later on ). My personal why ? The cost of living is very reasonable in my area . Take that and combined it with cheap labor and enormous growth from the surrounding you get a builder ’ s market . It is actually hard to keep track of all the in the area because there always to be new . When my wife and I decided it would be better for us to build rather than buy a house , we tried to narrow down which builder was right for us . After seeing countless open from multiple , we finally decided on one . We did as much research as we could to ensure we are making the right choice . He ’ t the but he ’ t the most expensive . It was a happy medium and the open house he us spectacular . We only found one review on the builder “ stay away ”. We the builder about the review but he said not to worry because whoever it was ’ t build with him . Since the site gave no option of trying to contact the reviewer , we decided to trust the builder . To this point he gave us no reason not to . He was very professional in how he himself and his company . Overall , we thought we had made a great choice and ’ t be more excited . The excitement faded as the construction process went on and the great choice , we thought we had made in our builder completely . First it out small with project not being met , then it to not getting by the builder so were sent to us . We knew the builder was getting because we were the the bank made out to the builder on each draw request . When this was brought to his attention , he said it was a misunderstanding . My wife and I both work but we still were at the house every day to check on the progress and answer any question or help in anyway . This to seem like a have - to rather than a want - to . , , electrical , . were being built not according to . We were constantly trying to get in touch with the project manager or owner to notify them of what was happening but they were mostly unavailable . The owner and project manager lying about different that were supposedly done on the house . For example : · The vapor barrier was not but they reassured us it us it was . We had them remove the brick to show us it was there and long behold there was nothing . A ton of brick had to be removed to put the vapor barrier in . · They tried to install regular insulation instead of the spray foam insulation and cover it up with before we could see it . We had to show them a copy of the contract to get them to honor it . · They wrong counter tops ( they switched them out later on ). · Plumbing with the shower not due to incorrect plumbing . · Secondary drain for was to drain into attic ( soffit ) rather than outside . · The list could go on and on . It got down to the point of me taking and making Power Point of what had to be done . On each picture it would have pointing to different showing what the issue was and what to be corrected . It silly but it to be working . The relationship between the builder and us over time because we were constantly on them . We were not trying to be a difficult customer by any . We just to make sure we were getting what we for . As this process went on , I found out I was not the only one multiple with this builder . Turns out everyone who we found that was currently building with this builder were all similar . After we all got to together , we legal action against the builder if he did not correct the . Slowly , we all got our but even now ( a year after construction ) we ’ re still trying to fight to get small around the house taking care . At this point we all believe we ’ re on our own as we keep getting the run around from the builder . My wife and I now understand just because the model house we saw fantastic ’ t mean the quality is there . We could only imagine what the quality of our house would have been like had we not been there each day . I believe this builder and like him will continue to cut as many as possible to their unless people know . To help this problem , I thought it would be beneficial to make a review that strictly home . There are a ton of review but when it comes to home , there needs to be a reputable easy to use site that will show both sides of the story . The client and the builder can review each other so the potential future will have an informed decision when it comes time to choose . I have been working on a through to review but there to be too many . I want people to give good honest and not have to worry about the character count in a review or if they can post / . I want the layout to navigate easy without set and on what can or can ’ t go .

If only I had the review up and running , I could have saved people like this from losing their life ’ s saving . Now the urgency is on to get a great review up and running . It more sense to create the on because I will not be limited to what I can or can ’ t have . The problem is , I don ’ t know a lot about and the it will take for me to learn and hopefully get the up and running is will have to get other people . The money I am will be used to hire outside help in building the . I ' already posted a job on Upwork ' s seeking qualified as I ' m familiar with Upwork ’ s process from previous experience . The break down for the budget would allow $ 3 , 000 for the creation , $ 1 , 000 for marketing , and $ 800 for web hosting , and bug ( for at lest the first two ).

What is Sound City Beat ? Sound City Beat is a tribute by The From Space to the rock and beat of the 1960s who tenaciously flew the flag for rock music at a time when the country preferred to listen to dance and ballad . Although a commercially viable rock scene did not really happen in until the 1980s , the urban of the country in the were of exciting young beat who out short in blues and tennis , some of them , like The , The , Orange Machine , , Ditch and the King Bees , The and Sugar Shack made some fine singles , , like Granny ' s , Strangely Strange , Apparent and ' s Dream , advanced to album , the ' medium of choice , and still more , like Them , Skid Row and Thin , were for major like Van , , , Terry , , Henry and Rory , whose work would come to maturity in the 70s , 80s and beyond .

Bounce is based on a community of people that instead of their as their exclusive possession , they transform them into a key to access of other of like - minded people . Bounce is about the efficient use of already to jump on and , attend , and live differently , regardless of where this is going to happen . Because today , as the world smaller and smaller , your life may happen somewhere else . Unlike other , this is neither about a place nor about the accommodation itself It ’ s more about the problem of the accommodation to let you focus on what you need to do in this specific moment of your life . And it ’ s not about : other ask you “ where would you like to go ?”. Bounce you “ where do you need to be ?”. HOW IT WORKS It ’ s very easy . You must own a property that you are willing to share with other while you are not there . Then you feel to pursue an opportunity which to move to another city or country . You list your place and then enter the destination of your choice and the period , ranging from 3 to 26 . Bounce will match all the information by like you to create as many viable as possible , according to the , which include place , period , number of bouncing people , special needs and flexibility on and . The other option is a direct search : in this case you find a person , in the Bounce community , who might have a suitable property that is already available or could be , and you contact her . Is the period matching ? Are you happy with each other ? Then you just subscribe and leave to enjoy your life there . You can enjoy someone else ' s place as long as you made your property available to : in Bounce , for every transaction , we use time as the currency , not money , apart from subscription ( see ). A rating system , the possibility to communicate with other , and technical support will help you to make it run smoothly . The Bounce platform can be on invitation . This that as a user , you contribute to the network trust and growth directly by inviting people you esteem , with in different and attractive . Inviting people is part of a reward mechanism offering . The Bounce philosophy is based on the idea that its own their own and : it ’ s a direct call to assume responsibility . Bounce one major rule : leave every place as you found it , possibly a little bit better off . It ’ s an invitation to care about , about future , like we should do for our future . It ’ s an invitation to make better . WHY BOUNCE ? It may sound strange to you but it all with a single question : why as a collective we produce that individually we don ' t want , like environmental , economic crisis , cultural and spiritual disconnection ? One of the we came with was that too many people are not living their according to their , and so they do not bring their best contribution to life . Many people are trapped into repetitive , under inspired by their and disengaged by their , disappointed by ’ and they do not understand or share . Many their for too long , while some other simply gave up . They made reasonable . We also believe that sometimes the we generate do not reflect our innate ability to perform but the complexion of the situation in which the performance . So we came with the idea that as the world smaller and smaller , by constant disruption and by unprecedented , we can help you to do something more and rewarding , something with a impact on your life and the of those close to you . According to us there ’ s plenty of to bounce . And that ’ s why we define Bounce a B2Be . WHY ? We have four our decision to Bounce . In order of importance they are : Make it happen : we deeply believe in the positive social impact of Bounce and this is us to transform a concept into a project , no matter what . Build a community : there ’ s no value - creation and delivery without a critical mass of that ( share ?) a reasonable number of . Bounce is for people , not for us . Be independent : we dream about Bounce together with its , before turning to business . We want to promote a culture of trust and respect , not of exponential growth . Think long - term : we think of additional and smoother , and those so far represent the first of many we have in mind . We believe that is the right place to achieve them . IS BOUNCE FOR YOU ?

I ' m not a real doctor , but I assume that when your mind is blown , your brain . I could be mistaken , but when the human brain , you ' re fairly certain to shuffle off the mortal coil . Trust me , it ' t benefit me in the least for you to die . In fact , I ' m counting on you , oh courageous reader , to live . "" I ' m not here to drop yet another hammer on the of humanity , nor to offer an emotional and hopeful appeal for peace and utopia through text . My intent and aspiration in this project is to take the most hotly , most chaos - , and most "" difficult "" to answer of life , and to answer them . How is this different from so many other past to bring humankind together ? Because this time , it ' s going to WORK . I am an average human being . This statement is not meant to belittle myself , but to paint a picture of similarity between us all . It only a few of personal thought to establish the we need in life , and the we want in living it . Easy enough . The real challenge in those , and THAT is only difficult because the of the world seem to directly resist us from our . It ' t take of of exhaustingly , a psychological breakdown of the human condition , or an - intellectual denouncement of the world at large . and the world ' s can ( and shall ) be done with simplicity . All it is a casual digital stroll around , , Twitter or to observe the attitude of the world at large . This Book Will KILL You is a straightforward , sensible , and modern attempt to communicate with each and every human being that it can reach . Ten is an excellent number , and a feeling of completion in itself . For that reason , I have established ten to be in this first installment . I believe that offering these ten in a rational , non - conversation with the reader will invoke the spirit of commonality in us all . They are : 1 . Religion . No , not a discussion of why religion is good or bad , but a way for us all to cope with our in the myriad on our , our purpose , and our destiny . It ' s not hard , and it no for those who use it as a to inflict harm on . 2 . Politics . Wow , one and two are the that are generally to be the worst possible discussion in polite conversation . Too bad , because they are both so relevant to how and why we live our , and I ' found a way to make them easy to digest , and without ruling any one ideology out as invalid or foolish . Winning . 3 . Love . How many times in just the past decade the subject of interpersonal love been with violence , hatred and sensationalism . No longer . If hearing how easy it is to live alongside your fellow human despite your sexual and emotional will kill you , chapter three is the end for you , friend . 4 . . Are they , or are they not the future ? OUR future , as the next chapter in the story of human kind .. why then is there no standard for the of their growth that will either help them become thoughtful , creative , inspired , loving .. or pessimistic and intolerant . The latter out with THIS generation , or are converted to the former . 5 . Money . Despite the of money as the ultimate evil , and the weapon of injustice , money is honestly meant to be tracker for one ' s productivity and helpfulness to the whole . That simple standard ideal been thoroughly corrupted , but in just a few easy , we can get back on track . For a nominal fee , of course ;) 6 . Craziness . A general term , but what it is a foreign idea to no one . People have been crazy since the first batch of us came around , and won ' t cease to be any time soon . Coping with craziness will help us all do everything possible to counteract the negativity it , and just may aid us in significantly human lunacy to a more manageable level . 7 . Violence . Like the formerly known as Monster ( Now Monster ) , are a "" sometimes "" food . Likewise , the human currently known as violence is a "" sometimes "" answer . When we really get down into the nitty - gritty of change and enlightenment , there are some people that are so stuck in their ways that they will resist to the bitter end , for destruction and menace rather than coexist with those that differ from them . For those people , I invoke not a with hot lead and , but a fair , honest and straightforward round of . Or , even better , vie for dominance on the latest first person shooter . Either way , the way to deal with , and eventually curb human violence , is laid out for young and old . Let ' s not repeat our past here , . 8 . Trust . Thanks to information availability in a decent portion of the planet , we have access to great of information about the past , present and future . Most of it the of human cruelty , and what some call ' mindless ' drivel to satisfy the . I would argue that there are as many the secrecy , conspiracy , and underhandedness of our unseen as there are of 7 + billion other human doing all they can to survive and thrive . In trusting in yourself , and in the rest of your species , in the hope of helping realize that we have only to unite to succeed at well .. everything . 9 . The Past . Whew , how about our , right ? So caught up in the need for more territory , more wealth , more legacy , that a fraction of a percent of us ( in the past ) wrought misery and slaughter on one another through the use of with iron and fire . There are as many of conquest , betrayal , enslavement and violent nationalism as there are past and present . While sometimes exciting , or dramatic to read and relive , is this what we want future to remember us for ? We have past this stage , whether you might think so or not , but a few simple about our may damn well put our present to . No sugar - coating , bias or favoritism to be found . 10 . The Future . How bright and beautiful it could be . How miserable , dark and desolate as well . Only by taking the time now , here and with one another in , do we stand to reach the gilded of luxury and glory that our for us . It won ' t take long . No more than the final chapter of ten in a brief , simple book as a matter of fact . We can have that conversation , you and I , and I promise not to fill it full of sugary sweet of utopia .

In a message sent on 6th , she said ' I finally was able to send everything out a couple of days ago ! I to message you to let you know that your drawing will arrive in an envelope separate from your deck and other .' I have to admit , I have found this experience heartbreaking . Personally , it was a huge financial investment to increase my pledge to purchase an original drawing and I feel so badly let down . I am at a loss for what else to do . I am so sorry you have also had the same experience . x 11 ago Hi , I have had a very similar experience with the : The 2nd message said "" Your drawing and should be soon !

I had told her at the time that I would wait for the rest of the stuff first and then make up my mind about it ( all of these about the deck were made around mid 2019 ). I am so disappointed in this experience and I feel sad and taken advantage of . This was the first time that I went the extra mile to get a custom drawing ( I ' never done that before ) and I was truly excited for this . I am also very sorry that you had to go through this . If would not have just completely the ball on the communication ( both over the store thing AND for these custom ) I feel it would have , at least a little , in feeling like we ' re not being or being taken advantage of , or being let down .

The Native Flute is an instrument that alone incredibly well . It also works well with accompaniment ranging from piano and acoustic guitar , to full and .

Take it it ' t normally found . The music will be mostly original music , written by myself in collaboration with the of my band . We have the , we have the vision , we just need to produce the product . It is my hope that you would be kind enough join us . Here is a little sample of the band our version of ' s Little Wing .

This made it an invaluable resource and was often considered the ‘ poor man ' s cow ’ due to its resourcefulness and . The species was crucial to the Cheese industry until the late 18th century . However , when new Swiss and were , they could produce far more milk and so the Primitive less appealing and were eventually completely . Today , the are subject to constant debate over whether they should be . Management of the Feral can alter according to the estate in which they are found . The main reason behind the culling of this species is to manage the in a herd . These can cause significant damage to an area if they remain there for a amount of time . A single goat can eat up to 2kg of food each day and with 70 % of their diet being wood - based , a small herd can strip an area in a small amount of time . If this is a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( ) or an area where woodland regeneration is taking place , then many and want the to be before they can damage to an important habitat . Although culling is important to many species , it of a certain habitat and the possibility of starvation to a herd . I believe the Primitive Goat needs to be in a specific way . With less than 1200 , it is important for such as National Heritage ( ) to look into different in herd . Another option that is currently being , is birth control in the Reserve . This involved 50 ( both male and female ) at being shot with a contraceptive dart . This way of without death is more costly as it took a team of from Animal Welfare a week to complete , but it does mean that the cannot breed for 3 after injection , and will naturally fall . Another solution to culling and birth control of the is to be taken into an animal sanctuary . Hillside animal sanctuary ( based outside ) to take a number of the instead of the .

Like fix social media . I don ’ t have to tell you that the current social have big . Everyone ’ s talking about it , but nobody to be coming up with real . It ’ t have to be an all or nothing approach . I . I . I . I came up with a well rounded approach . You can tell me what you think by supporting this project , or not . The choice is yours . That is the theme of the Owl . It ’ s all about the YOU make . How do you want YOUR social media to work for you ? OUR MISSION : Privacy . It ’ s not just about what you post , but also how you are being tracked . We don ’ t track you . Content . See what you want AND turn off what you don ’ t want . . Better control of how you connect with people . . You decide how your use social media with . . Help out and we help you . . Make money on your content by or . . We don ’ t hide your content to your audience . . We guarantee your promotion . / . Easily find and connect with . E - commerce . , marketing , and in the same place . Please allow us to take you on a tour through the Owl . Hop in a mine cart , we are heading down the shaft . One feature to the next so it ’ s best to read in order . and First , let ’ s talk about people in the Owl . This is one core feature that us apart from everyone else . We have to take a step back to understand an account to then understand how are made to them . Social Media is strictly about the . Without these it would be just another media site , and still I have yet to see explaining how their work . Every account sub - . For example , you could have a friend , family , and work sub - account . Each account can have its own profile and if someone to connect , YOU decide which sub - account they are associated with . You can keep your work account professional , and share your child only to your family account . By the way , you could connect people more than one way . Add a family member to your family AND friend account . When , you decide where to share to . These sub - allow way more control and ease than simply of people . If you are in the public eye , you don ’ t have to connect people to any account , you may simply set their request to “ follow me ” to allow them to view your public of information . ( Ya , we went there … in the Owl , “ ” are content , the are mining of information , whether it be a post , picture , video or other content ) Rejoice ! Behold the Child This us to the child sub - account ! A much feature for . You may create one or more child . set access control based on age appropriateness among other . On top of that , we are a soon to be patent pending process by which a parent can turn this feature on , and before a child to view any content , a parent account can view this content first . only have to mark they don ’ t want their to view . That ’ s not all ! Let ’ s talk about our rating system . Rating System All are rated for age appropriateness when ( if you don ’ t know what a nugget is , read above ). By default , everything is rated Adult . To get anything rated below that ( toddler , child , teen ), it will go through our process of being by other . Why would anyone bother to help ? Aha , this us to another core feature of the Owl , the ! Reward System for helping Let me start with saying I don ’ t believe in getting something for nothing . We need your help . Social Media NEEDS your help . Instead of complex computer intensive AI to scan all data to figure out correctness ( like if something is rated correctly ), it is much easier and more efficient to allow the opportunity . For example , a video might have a question “ Is this suitable for a child ” and when enough people agree , it will get that child rating . When you help us with different , we will reward you with a virtual gem . These all have different and depending on what was done to receive them . They can be used towards advanced we have , or even transferred to . The also add up on an official tally of total . Even if you transfer them , it does not affect your total tally . What is a tally used for ? First off , the tally may be hidden or shown publicly . Since each gem a meaning , it could be used to show other how helpful one is at something . For example , since we are e - commerce , a member might receive a type of gem to indicate they have successfully . Seeing a high tally could put at ease in doing . Be careful , we also have the opposite of if something negative is done ! Use it or not , it ’ s another tool for you . ! Here is another big difference in the Owl . When posting any of information , it must include at least one but no more than two most relevant to tell what it is about . Is it humor or is it politics ? Maybe it is both . helping make sure these are correct are another way to earn via . It is with these that the true power of filtering comes in . Filtering We all know someone who is annoying with what they post . At the heart of our feed system is content filtering that you ultimate control . If you don ’ t like that one Uncle ’ s political , turn off ALL politics from him only but keep his humor coming . Maybe you are sick and tired of politics in general – turn it off from EVERYONE ! Take it out of your feed . Done . Maybe you are a bad day and need some inspirational . Find only those in the Owl to give yourself a pick - me - up . Speaking of pick - me - , how does one pick - themselves - up some cash ? With from advertising a business on other , I thought to myself I ’ d rather have just given my money to my audience . And behold , a new form of advertising was born in the Owl . When a local business to promote , they choose the target size to reach , put up money towards a view count and it goes into a special shaft ( a shaft is a “ channel of content ”). There you can find and share . The unique view count you generate is to YOU . The Owl all 50 - 50 . When the promotion is done , it off . reach their , you are happy , we are happy . What if you are looking for a , more targeted or nationwide audience to reach ? Sponsor a Publisher Everyone is technically a publisher , but once one gains a certain level of you may join the program and seek out or . At the same time , are seeking whose content is in - line with their targeted audience . How Works We are providing the metrics on the publisher ( for example , how many , type of content they share , .) so an advertiser can find and target an audience they want . It works both ways - a publisher can also seek out a sponsor . We leave the between publisher and advertiser and we split the revenue 50 - 50 . That is how we make money and you make money . WE DON ’ T RUN TO COMPETE . If an advertiser is seeking a large audience they must engage a publisher through our . Let ’ s be clear , to join the program , it is subscription based dependent on the amount of you have . Everyone is free up to a certain amount . The more , the more it , HOWEVER the reason is two - fold . First , we don ’ t restrict what your see from you . That a huge toll on . So if you ’ t want to run or get , we ’ t make any money . could be if they had a large following , and maybe a large business ’ t want to bother with , they just want unfiltered access to their audience . Paying a monthly fee might make more sense to them . could also run just enough to cover the subscription . The choice is theirs . If you ’ t read anything else , READ THIS SECTION AGAIN . This is at the heart of how we make money and you can make money while not to collect any data and to sell to . DO NOT LET TELL YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR PRIVATE DATA IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE ! Privacy When people say , “ But I don ’ t share much on social media , I have no ” that absolutely me up a wall . That me YOU are the who need to be woke . Social media is not just what you post , they track where you go after you leave them , what you at on OTHER , what background information they can pick up on your , where your look on a page , of your whereabouts , it goes on and on . It ’ s not just social media , it ’ s other as well . You don ’ t have to believe me , look it up ! Wake up ! This was the first problem that all other must not invade . We can ’ t wake everyone up , but we can do our part to protect the Owl by being crystal clear about what data we use and how we use it . Our privacy with verification . You might not have to be to use Owl , but what you can do will be limited . want to know if this is really wanting to be , or is it ’ s hacker wanting to be . To protect you and your family , we need a higher level of verification as to who is our service . We are also dealing with currency . That an even higher level of verification . Verification is NOT invasion of privacy . stealing data that ’ t have been collected in the first place IS an invasion . That is one thing we need to protect . E - commerce If you don ’ t know what e - commerce is , skip ahead because we are not explaining that here . What we will say is we are e - commerce right into the heart of our platform . Do you run a small e - commerce site now ? are you could set up shop in the Owl where you have your and product all in one place . We have great in store , but I ’ already told the competition too much . What else can I do in the Owl ? The starting are simple , you can do anything legal unless it ’ s too heavily regulated . Even then we will be building the to comply with regulation if our want it . We want free speech , not hate speech directed at any group . There is a difference . We defined it . Absolutely no harassment or bullying will be to or from a child account . Let ’ s be more responsible at the Owl . Platform of There is much we , and much we haven ’ t .

When I was twenty - eight , National Geographic Magazine sent me on the assignment of a lifetime : to document the 1 , 700 mile journey of a mysterious twenty - seven - year - old woman , who was across the outback alone with four and her dog , . During ’ s nine - month journey I tracked her down five times , spending about three traveling with her and shooting of of . "" more that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else "" - Bill , In a Sunburned Country I was fascinated by ' s courage and her intense desire to learn from about their culture . I had never a love affair like the one she had with her Kelpie pup , ( who she had as a puppy from an animal testing lab two before her trip ). And I was constantly amazed by her perspective on life , on friendship and her brutal honesty with her own short . Most of all I was fascinated to spend time with someone who , instead of running away from her , faced them head on , constantly herself . Even though had spent two , the outback had many ways of testing even the most capable traveler ; she was by wild , took that led to dead , got lost , at that were dry and almost of dehydration . Every time I left her out there , I worried that I might never see her again . When ’ s story in a 32 - page cover story in National Geographic it caught the world ’ s imagination , reaching over 50 million . ( the book ): went on to write a book which her publisher to sell modestly , with an initial print run of only a few thousand . went on to become a global phenomenon , selling more than a million in 18 . It won the "" Cook Travel Writing Award "" and the ignominious honor of being the year ' s “ Most Stolen Book ”! This description from is a wonderful overview of why her story around the globe : "" went to the dead heart of in pursuit of a dream : to cross the desert alone . Her journey took her across an ancient , secret land and the outback worked its magic on her life in strange and subtle ways . From an Aboriginal tribal elder learned desert sense , and from an camel herder she learnt to master , ride , outwit and care for the that her pack and . Her voyage led to the discovery of self as well as to the profound beauty and nobility of a land and its indigenous people ."" ( the movie ): Given the power of ' s writing , I ' t have been when the - winning of The Speech out and told me they were going to turn ’ s legendary adventure into a feature film . They cast , a wonderful twenty - four - year - old chameleon - like actress ( in Wonderland ) as , and Driver ( ' s heartthrob in ’ s ) as yours truly , the . Here is the trailer for the movie , , which reaching this fall . The movie is being distributed by the legendary Company and been generating rave around the globe . Which me to my Campaign for a brand new book I ' m INSIDE : INSIDE : When I found out that ’ s story was being into a feature film I and we the idea of my self - a large 224 - page landscape coffee - table book ( 30 - wide when open ) which would enable to feel as if they are joining on her journey . She the idea and we came up with a book that would weave together three experience of her journey : memorable from her book , the best of my plus striking and screenplay from the movie . INSIDE is three in one : 1 ) The first half of the book is a visual story my , many of which have never been seen before , and inspiring from ’ s best - selling memoir , . INSIDE from ' s original journey INSIDE from ' s original journey 2 ) The second half of the book fascinating from the movie , screenplay , behind the / making - of , as well as short reflecting on the journey written by , the director of the movie , and by me ( Rick ). INSIDE from the movie INSIDE from the movie The in this section were shot by , a fantastically talented set photographer , and Walker the film ’ s Director of Photography . Because many of the film ' s were based on my original , it ’ s almost impossible to tell which are from the movie and which are from the original trek . 3 ) The most delightful component of INSIDE is the integration of ’ s technology . will be to a free ( available on & Play ). You simply point your phone or tablet at specially marked and immediately ( and I mean immediately ) you ’ see a clip from the movie showing how that photograph was brought to life in the movie . Use of Funds INSIDE is a labor of love . My son proudly an early sample of INSIDE I INSIDE being printed on heavy matte paper in six colors ( most are printed in only four ) plus a spot varnish on every photograph to make the color pop off the page . I the concept of INSIDE to many but , while many my enthusiasm for the book , I ’ t find any publisher that would commit to the quality of production that I felt this book deserved . So , I am turning to the community to help fund the considerable involved in self - and INSIDE . Special Heavy Duty Edition Carton INSIDE is not like most of the you find in these days . Most are very conservative - they play it safe , keep down , and think that "" average "" quality is good enough . INSIDE is not going to be average , it ’ s going to be spectacular . The book will integrate a level of printing and production quality that you rarely see in . To achieve this goal I had all of the original drum at extremely high resolution and , a color correction wizard to optimize each image . , a wonderfully talented art director and designer , spent seamlessly weaving together the original trek , the from the movie , and the new technology that the original to life . Brad , a printing expert , is the print run . Finally , I ' engaged Holly Jacobus , a brilliant marketer , to focus on raising awareness of INSIDE in the , photography , film , technology , and smart device . If funds are raised in excess of my goal ( crossed !) the money will be used to expand the awareness of INSIDE through additional marketing and publicity throughout the upcoming holiday season . My hope is that INSIDE will help expand the audience for ’ s inspiring story and the underlying message of her journey , that “ an ordinary person is capable of anything ”.

CA,0.78763352,2500,7489.0,True,False,1,domestic,"- A short creature film We ' re of one of ’ s classic tales of terror into an short film , combining live action with motion capture and stop motion animation . The Story In the year 1920 , a young writer is tormented nightly by apocalyptic of a strange ruined city , where the last of humanity are down by ravenous eldritch ! There is no place to hide , for the great Old have returned , and they have the world as their own . The Origin of the When it comes to the work of writer H . P . ' s , the thing that most people remember are the that he . Undying alien , and beyond man ' s feeble comprehension , like the great , - , and the Demon Sultan . But these were not the first that saw in his imagination . For when he was younger , that he was by a vivid nightmare . In these , found himself trapped in a strange city , with bizarre and alien geometry . And then , swarming out of the darkness he would see them . A race of faceless flying . Horned , black , and slender , with membranous bat - like . Every night he would run from these , and every night they would chase him down . They would pull him screaming into the air in their , and carry him over a hellish world teeming with shapeless . This early experience would leave a lasting impression in his work as a writer , with these terrifying creeping into his work time and time again . After 30 , he write down his nightmare , turning it into a short piece ' '. PLAY Adaptation any adaptation comes with , but it is especially difficult when it comes to ' s writing . The power of his work ' t in the that happen in the plot , but its in the way he . The deeply unsettling mood that he to create . and of cosmic that utterly dwarf his and the reader , to create an overwhelming sensation of helplessness . The constant looming threat fearfully throughout the mythos he is the inescapable prophecy that one day mankind will be off the planet when the Old awaken to reclaim the world as their own . In our film , we want to bring ' s apocalyptic vision to life . To show one dreamer ' s terrifying glimpse of a future world , where behemoth alien tower over the of man . Where the last are reduced to like our mammal during the Age of tyrant . in the , like under a stone , and from hungry of that pick off the last . We aim to capture this oppressive atmosphere through our use of and experimental film making . For inspiration , we ' been looking at German expressionist and of the 1920 ' s . In particular we are drawn to the work , creator of ( 1922 ) and Faust ( 1926 ). ( 1922 ) and Faust ( 1926 ) We want to emulate his expert use of bold angle , dark , and bold mythical poetic . By combing live action , photomontage , and both 3d and stop motion animation together , we aim to create a film that like a lucid nightmare . Here is an early test clip that we put together last month , show some of the we will be with . PLAY The Creature Design One of the main of our project is the chance to bring some of ' s classic to life in a new way . Now the have been around a long time .

How ' floating ' my life I experienced my first float about a year ago ... at the time I had just graduated from high school , knew that I ' t want to continue education at a university and thus decided to move to Colorado for the winter ... previously living in my whole life . The move ended up turning into a five month road trip that took me all across Western half of the United , down through New and , along the coast of and up to where I then flew out to the Big Island of to do work trade for a Hotel / Hostel . After 2 of living in middle of the Pacific Ocean and many nights sleeping under the I finally made my way back to . I first about floating on the while watching a Joe Rogan during . ' s history class back in high school . With my interest hooked , I dove head first into everything there was to know about this strange new thing people ' floating ' and what it ' s all about . I said to myself that one day I will experience floating first hand ... sure enough while on my road trip across the US , that day came . I booked an appointment at a wellness center in right before taking off from Colorado ... A few days later ... ... Upon waking up surrounded by cacti in my White which was on the side of a Freeway somewhere outside of Phoenix , I to drive into town for my float ... Mental Clarity is what I received from those 60 of floating ... In the midst of being in the tank , I lost sense of which way my body was . Gradually this feeling came over me that I was floating in space and then I was actually seeing my body float through space at what felt like million an hour , but I was completely relaxed and calm ... It was incredible because ever since I was a I had always about the of space , and now I was it . The feeling I had immediately after stepping out of the tank was like none other . My body felt as light as a cloud , my mind was crystal clear , I had an almost overwhelming sense of calmness and everything to have a subtle glimmering shine to it .. like how I imagine a filthy , mud vehicle would feel right after a trip to the car wash ... with that wonderful clean car smell and spotless glossy finish . I ' t just feel super relaxed and calm .. it was different than that . It was a whole new level of relaxation , calmness and healing that I not just on a physical level , but on a mental level as well . I felt a greater sense of appreciation for all . It was simply a time for my mind and body to let it ' s guard down and just be .. to heal and repair any within myself . It was a feeling of total rejuvenation and healing of my whole being , unlike anything I had ever felt before .

We ’ re making a yearbook and future , dynamic , and successful along the way !!! are a tradition for many middle across the country , but that tradition is just beginning at The Pinnacle Charter Middle School this year . Prior to this year the college - prep middle school had been briefly included in The Pinnacle Charter High School yearbook . But this year is different . For the first time the middle school at The Pinnacle Charter School in Federal , Colorado , are , designing , selling , marketing , and leading the FIRST EVER Pinnacle Charter Middle School ( ONLY !!) Yearbook . But we need your help in making this project happen ! Our Cover Sketch Why is yearbook SO important ? In a day and age when elective classes are being cut and from , yearbook class remains a great educational experience for all involved . , a yearbook printing company , a list of 30 learn by being a part of yearbook / journalism classes . These include technology ( business , , photo - , design , research ), life ( communication , leadership , time management , project management , problem , writing , photography , , conflict resolution , public speaking ), journalism ( concept , , , copy , photo , graphic , public , media law , design ), and business ( budget , promotion and advertising , marketing , selling , customer , market research ). These will not only help in middle school , but will carry them into success in high school , college , and beyond . In fact , The Newspaper Association of in 2008 a study showing that who participate in their school ’ s newspaper or yearbook scored better on college entrance and better writing and grammar than those who did not . The yearbook also have an opportunity to showcase their artistic , academic , and leadership outside of a traditional class and athletics . For many of the 32 staff , yearbook class is their first taste at creative freedom and leadership . All five of the 8th in the class have been given a leadership position this year . For some of them it is their first opportunity to have such great responsibility and earn their ’ respect . In addition to brightening the future of the involved in yearbook class , the yearbook the student body by everyone from school in the book . The goal of the Pinnacle Middle School Yearbook staff is to have every middle school student in the book three times . This a whole picture of the student body , not simply a snapshot of those most involved . How much do you need ? We ’ re trying to raise $ 4 , 000 . This is two - of the total $ 6 , 000 we need to produce and print 250 + of the yearbook . The 250 + production number is important because this the cost of the to $ 30 per book and will provide a very small reserve to purchase one or two digital for the to use . We believe , through survey from , many will purchase a yearbook once printed . However , it after it is printed it difficult for us to front the money to print the from our non - existent budget , especially since this is the first year of the class and product . The Pinnacle Charter School kindergarten through 12th grade , with approximately 56 percent of on free or reduced lunch . This that many to purchase something they have never seen before and do not quite know the value of is too much . In the past the middle school did not have their own yearbook and thus many did not purchase one . However , through a survey we have discovered that many want to purchase one this year , but either do not know what a yearbook is or do not have the money . If we are unable to order an adequate number of , we may have to refund the so far and all of the ’ hard work and effort will be for naught . We truly believe with some generous community backing we will be able to produce an amazing book that the year and with for ever . What will the money go toward ? The money raised here will go toward printing the remainder of the unsold 250 of the book to keep the at $ 30 per yearbook . These will then be sold or given to determined to be economically unable to afford to purchase one and deserving of one by , , , and . The money we make back from the of the , or that remains from this project will be used to purchase for the Pinnacle Middle School Yearbook course . The staff currently access to only one camera -- a 10 - year - old camera that was graciously donated to us – to share among 32 excited student . By being able to purchase more the will be able to put the photography they have learned to use and capture more of the student body for the yearbook . What else can I do to help ?

I was a little hesitant to say the side shelf can be underneath since it just barely ( if you want access to the storage on both sides of the table , as I ’ shown in the ) and I ’ m still a bit worried about the back half of the shelf that low . Watch your :) It ’ s also a bit heavy to be lining up while hanging it under the table . That said we have put ours under there before , but honestly the side shelf rarely left our table since our new . Most rule fit on it quite well ( except Pendulum ). Dan 6 ago Received and in PA . Got enough for the storage under the table as well and glad to say it the side tables underneath as well . Great job ! Rob 6 ago another 32 into the mail today ! Graham 6 ago Received and here . Installation tool was great and made placement / alignment a breeze . The are a little bit looser than the wood that shipped on the table but it like they should still hold alright . Going to be nice to have cup on the of the long ! Rob 6 ago Really glad to hear the installation was easy ! I ' m a bit though that the fit looser than the stock , as I ' made these slightly than the stock to give it just a little bit of a fit . I ' d actually had the quite a bit than the stock originally but it back down towards the stock sizing when I from a ' for our table only ' project to a all and Duchess ' ever project . It turns out there is a fair amount of variation in the dovetail sizing all around , multiple of the groove , . Would you mind a photo or two with me on the fit between the stock and the new , at support @ . ? Curious also if you tried all your cup and if the are consistent . We have one cup holder on our end that the in the cup holder don ' t quite line up with the shape of the mount , and its pretty loose all around our table . Graham 6 ago Rob , sent to that address .

Showing 3 of 4 Load previous Rob 6 ago Would you mind sending me a photo over at support @ . of the fit of the Riser in the Wine Glass Holder ? Its very possible that the first batch of Wine you got with your table were made with a smaller opening , and got before any we ' seen . That said , the fit is supposed to be a bit tight , not overly so , but tight enough that theres enough resistance that the Riser does not spin freely , but not too much that its hard for you to rotate it to ' lock ' in the glass , if desired . Depending how tight the on the hole in the Wine Glass Holder is , this could result in the opening being made slightly smaller , as you ' . Either way , would love to see a photo of the fit your , but glad you ' a simple work around that your favorite glass . 6 ago @ Rob , I will try to get to it this weekend . It does fit nicely , snug but able to spin . But with the insert flush to one side of the opening , I lose about 3 / 8 "" on the other side ( so overall gap is 3 / 8 "" smaller with the insert ). I ' likely shave 1 / 2 "" off and it should work as . ( but I will try to get a picture out to you .). 6 ago @ Rob , I sent a couple today . Let me know if you don ' t get them .

US,1.0,2300,7543.92,True,False,1,domestic,"Stretch Goal Progress Thanks for out the project ! Hopefully you are here because you are interested and a fellow fan of . The short of it , I am looking to produce an book I have for of and the original . Inside the book are nearly 1000 from on the original , filling over 700 . The focus of this book are on all the Computer Entertainment of ( ) during the complete life of the system . That from 1995 all the way through the twilight ( and beyond , really ) in 2005 . Giant , no fluff , all nostalgia . What is it ? ' s : A Chronological Visual Retrospective of from 1995 - 2005 is a mouthful , but its a book . An 8 "" x 6 "" book covering 151 different , 700 + , nearly 1000 , and that ' s it . There are plenty of other excellent people and quality gaming content with , developer , history and more . This book ' t that . I see this being a companion book for looking for more simple , nostalgic content . My goal is to let the and your own tell the story . The filter and scope is that all the inside this book were by themselves . It is organized by release date , so with each page you see the progression and evolution of the technological and of the original . Cover Mock Inside Mock Why ? I am posing this question , but I don ' t have a real answer . Basically , I just want a copy of this book for myself . I am there are enough interested in it so I can actually print it and have one . I ' been a long time fan of magazine and Micro Action magazine . They do an excellent job covering the classic , and sometimes those full page and double page blown up tell a whole story . That was the inspiration for this project . Personally , I have always what done . I know many people swear by and pray at the alter of , but call me a blasphemer , there is no better publisher than . Now I will admit not all of their are gold , but they take on all of . They do unique and weird , , , casual , everything . I love that about them , and I love the they make doing that . Some people think I am crazy , but I know plenty of agree with me . This project is for us . Is my favorite game in this ? That game was good ! Maybe ? If it , it ' s in here . This is EVERY game they and here in North . Nothing is missing from their , but if your favorite game is Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Tony Hawk ' s Pro Skater 2 , then you ' be disappointed . Is your favorite game the Rapper or Twisted Metal 2 ? They ' re here ! Is it Final Fantasy ? You ' re in luck ! ( at the time ) had a deal and was the publisher here in NA . If this project does well , I would love to do smaller follow - up like ' s , ' s , ' s and more . I hope that up the direction of the project . I backed the project but what does "" plus any additional from campaign progress "" mean ? Is the goal not actually $ 2300 ? Good eye ! I want this project to exist , so that is how I built this campaign . The printing quote I got was the print run I could do . Meeting this goal would produce an awesome book for us all to have , but I personally want to see more . The more support this campaign the more it will upgrade what you all get as a reward with no extra from you . The ultimate version I want to produce that I got a quote for would be a matte finished cover with unique spot finish bound book with a cool slipcase to protect it all ( this is happening !). I have an idea of some fun "" memory card "" ( and we made them !). If it REAL crazy , additional with more , paper quality , ( and we did this !). All funds will allow the project to grow and improve and benefit everyone getting a copy of the book . This is also in taking their 5 % and other and that come with in this platform . How did you find these and data ? Are you sure this is everything ? Yeah , I think so . I did a lot of research and and data for this project . I don ’ t even know if i could factor how much time was spent total . To start , I found two conflicting of complete for the original along with inaccurate release date information . I the two and found some more within that new list . I then used two separate data - based ( and the ) to cross check and validate . I then took all that data and read through old of , Game Informer , , , Game and more to be a 3rd source of validation for release and . Everything I now have is as accurate as it can be , at this point . For fun , I also included ' s identifier with each game ... just because . Now , is there a chance I still something ? Sure . I hope I ' t , but if I did , I ' d love to know about it so I can correct and / or update my data and be as complete as I can be . I know I ' t miss 99 , because that game ' t exist . It was just before release and you can technically find a playable build of it , but it ' t ever officially in the wild . It was one of the last / 989 made before Killer took over for 2001 . That ' s you ' have at your if you get a copy of this book . I have a question , what do I do ? Reach out to me here on or find me on social media . Twitter and I am @ , you can search for .

Unfortunately , there are a couple of on the slipcase : on the bottom of one of the sides , it is indented a little bit and on the end that "" ' s "" there to be some minor tearing / separating of the paper toward the top . And I assume this is an issue with the spot , but I there were tiny of material that like plastic off on both the slipcase and the book , mostly around the . But again , just to emphasize : this is all very minor to me , I just want you to be aware of it because I know you have for more in the future . I don ' t think any of the damage is your fault , because the package was extremely well - ( rolled multiple times in bubble wrap !), it ' s obvious you did your part in trying to make sure it ' t . I assume the are from when the distributor originally mailed the out . All of that aside , I want to end on a positive note : I ' m happy with it , and the above are really not a deal - breaker , I just want you to be aware for your future in case you plan on making any .

Please reply back . 4 ago Thank you for this . 4 ago Hi , it was a monumental undertaking and you it off , but I would definitely have with your printing partner when you can as there are quite a few with the entire presentation that I hope you can work out before future . The image bleed to edge needs to be taken into account because nearly every image is every so slightly off in the thus the composition of the and . Easiest way to see this is when you compare the against the proof . It is especially noticeable in the four image in which the become asymmetrical thus from the layout . Secondly , resolution of the is great but the color saturation and contrast is not balanced thus causing a great deal of to be very hard to read . I know that the industry now is pretty much set on ' s as , but I would make sure that future are in so there is 0 deviation from what you painstakingly laid out ! They need to crop their better as well as I had a pretty surprisingly high amount of loose in there . The slip cover was a really nice touch , but I already see it beginning to peel up . That "" Made in China "" sticker was also god - awful ugly and difficult to remove without part of the cover . There were also a handful of missing from the and I don ' t remember if you said you them or switched them out . I would make note of the and let your printer know as their should not detract from your work . Nonetheless , off to you sir , and I look forward to the next one ! 4 ago Got the book . Great !

The are large , and it ’ s quite noticeable that the are missing . In fact , when I the first finished painting to Glory , the subject , the initial response from her was , “ Glory ! Where are her ?” Nonetheless , I still ’ t come up with an eloquent , genuine answer . Instead , I : it ’ s a new type of portrait ; I ’ m exploring with artistic such as composition , negative space , and shape . - verbally , it was more , but I ’ t muster up the without sounding hostile in . However , now I am ready to tell you why I am not painting the . In today ’ s society , we have access to anything , everything , all the time . On my way to work , I an advertisement for a smart phone . A small , curious boy his father a question , “ Daddy , what are made out of ?” He ’ t know the answer off the top of his head , so the father quickly out his phone and , with a sigh of relief , or his son ’ s question . Within , he , “ are made out of five basic : a resilient , positive and negative internal made of lead , plate made of porous , electrolyte , a dilute solution of sulfuric acid and water , better known as battery acid , and lead , the connection point between the batter and whatever it .” He is happy , his son is informed , and we are convinced to buy a smart phone . Convenient , immediate , accurate : the world is at our . Not only technology given us the ability to know all the , but it made every corner of virtually accessible to anyone . I can see the Northern , the ancient , the Taj , or the Petrified Forest with a few . I can see whatever I want . This availability me wonder : if I ’ seen the , have it ? I know what it like , and my imagination can only take it from there . Imagine this situation : my friend in great detail her trip to National Park , and I respond with an unimpressed , “ Oh , cool , well , I ’ seen , .” Or , “ Did you make it to Watchman trail , the one that about two ? Hopefully you ’ t hike it during mid - day , because it pretty hot . The best time to hike it is either in the early morning or late afternoon . I ’ read all about it . I know .” We can any remote spot in the world and speak as though we ’ been there , experienced it . What if all this access and availability is tricking us ? Have we truly experienced by solely seeing ? What about the other four ? What about the emotion and spirituality that come with these ? Honestly , I haven ’ t lived National Park – I don ’ t know what the smell like , what the wind like , what the dust like , or what the desert sound like . So what when we see about in ? We see the white man holding the , most frail - looking child in an effort to convince us to get involved , to give money , or at least to reconsider tossing our in the wastebasket . This commercial turned into a . In a multitude of , school , five star , at our own dinner tables , we hear : “( Child ’ s name ), there are ( adjective ) in ( country ).” This is by , “ So eat your food .” the child only convinced us to clean our ? Surely , that ’ t the objective of the commercial . On the other hand , because we ’ seen the of the child ’ s big , her jigger - eaten , pointy , and sorrowful face , we have visually experienced her situation . Because we ’ seen it , maybe we can imagine what it would be like , to some extent . But for the most part , we continue on with our normal day - to - day , guilt - free : after all , we ’ re here , they ’ re there . The reality is , the girl seen . But she also smelled , tasted , , and touched without needing to use her imagination . Those may have seen her father kill his wife , and then himself . That nose may have smelled the of alcohol that accompany physical abuse . Those may have tasted blood after being beaten by a jealous and contemptuous stepfather . Those have her mother , in an effort to support her family , moan as a stranger himself into her . And perhaps those have the paper with her national exam , while her heart felt the utter hopelessness by an impossible , corrupted test for which the cannot prepare their , and which an unfavorable future . And we think we ’ experienced something by seeing a photograph . Something is missing . Something is not quite right . is exactly what I want people to feel when they look at a wall of eyeless : dissatisfaction . I hope that this emotion will evoke , “ Why are the missing ? What this child seen ?” I don ’ t want to tell the whole story , because we don ’ t know the whole story . Not one of us , me included , any idea what these have . If I give the impression that the whole story is told , like it to be in the commercial , we leave unchanged . We feel as though we ’ experienced , and thus , can relate .

I found the character creation of this game set the stage to build a universe that the into and through the story . You could go into this game not knowing what kind of character you want to play , roll the dice , have some , and play the that comes out of it . You could also go into this game with a character in mind , roll those same dice , have some , and get a character mostly like what you want , but maybe that shotgun you was taken by someone else ( grumble ) and you ended up with a key to the bank and a stick of dynamite ... like the start of a story ...

Like in Fiasco , whether you win or lose is inconsequential , or at least victory won ’ t matter much since it ’ s all about the journey , not the destination .

You may be working with another character just to discover they ' been waiting for the right moment for a double - cross . The are just ready for you to craft whatever plan you can think of .

Fish may be due to found in plastic . And it is nearly impossible to go to a beach without finding a piece of plastic pollution . Historically , plastic debris in the ocean was thought to be from the fishing and cruise ship industry , but now believe that about 80 % of plastic pollution comes from run - off ( through storm and trash blowing into the ocean ) and unregulated trash management ( not all have the same kind of trash control as the ). Before 1965 , trash was composed of paper goods , food , and other material but since the plastic bottle and plastic booming , our trash become more durable ( plastic and of to breakdown and never ). The plastic pollution found in the ocean is mainly plastic bottle , plastic , plastic , plastic , plastic , plastic , plastic food ... this is the plastic material that we all use in our everyday and I am sure we can live without a lot of it .

His father ’ s favorite phrase was : “ You can fail for multiple times , but you have to learn from each failure and you must be steadfast in your work . In the art world you ' chosen , not even an ounce of falsehood is .” This pursuit of perfection Sun to move forward , seeing him through to the day when he could taste success . From his first success of porcelain in 2013 until today , Sun ’ s team not only the beauty of , they have also received high appraisal and recognition from the world of ceramics . The head of the National Museum of China ’ s center for appraisal of cultural , , : “ the imperial technique of , a contemporary artistic treasure . Today ’ s are tomorrow ’ s cultural .” "" Celestial Vase "" by Sun was brought by - 2 to the outer space on 25 , 2016 , the Mid - Autumn Day THE HANDCRAFT & PRODUCTION ： Why each piece of porcelain is so valuable ? The extremely difficult production in very few works . The production of porcelain 167 , from hand clay and the painting method , to the application of color and repeated . To this day new , works continue to be made . Each step must be carried out flawlessly as even the of can destroy any hope of a piece . Why was the research process so difficult ? The first reason is the rarity of the raw material . The second is the complexity of the decorative process . The third is the difficulty of the firing process . These severely limit the amount of porcelain that can be made . works are extremely rare . The raw clay used to produce porcelain must be extremely pure . From one ton of porcelain clay , only half a kilo is suitable for use . Similarly , only pure , natural precious can be used to make for color . They cannot have , and must be high density and high luster . During the Dynasty , the oil used for porcelain , Dolmen oil , was from and cannot be found today . Its are also impossible to trace . Sun ’ s team their own natural vegetable - based oil ( Dolmen oil ) used to mix the of porcelain , and through countless , they the dilemma of finding an adhesive that could bind the pigment to the ceramic surface . The decorative patterning of porcelain are elaborate and similar to oil painting , oil as one of the . With no foundation or clear glaze on the surface necessary , simply the thickness of the color itself variation of causing the decorative pattern to visibly protrude and giving it a sparkling luster . With a wide range of in color , fine can be for appreciation . The firing process of porcelain is also very difficult and from the firing process of blue and white ceramics — which can be in a single firing . porcelain must be fired multiple times . The must be and color , then sent back into the kiln all before a perfect piece can be . This the rate of completion extremely limited . The firing process of porcelain is also rife with . With in the weather ’ s humidity , the heat of the kiln and the time for firing may vary . Across the four of the year , the temperature of the kiln , the time for firing , and the object ’ s position inside in the kiln may very . If these are not further , the are high . Data from the tremendous number of and been collected by Sun ’ s team , with of for the different color all forming a large . With any given piece , the team can use their own color , from the data , and compare them to the porcelain to gauge what temperature and what humidity in the effect . These have all been studied quite thoroughly . How To Appreciate ? According to The Book of Ceramics , There are "" four of porcelain "": "" White grain , as white as snow — the first ; Thin as eggshell or the murmur of desire a lover ’ s — the second ; Refinement in even the of , light upon flower into a breadth of brilliant colors and the soft down of butterfly , while the neck is poised gracefully — the third . Writing and motif in calligraphy and seal are as thin as the head of a fly — the fourth ."" "" Butterfly Cup – Cup With Budding And "" & Why : The design was inspired by the invaluable counterpart to the collection of the Art Institute of from the period . The Butterfly is one of China ’ s of eternal love : two appear with entangled , the continuous circle of life and gift down from generation to generation . Butterfly everlasting love , commitment and loyalty . The cup the wish for love and eternity . for the Butterfly cup the carpentry of the Dynasty , ( evergreen ) wood to make an opulent case with mortise and tenon . From the first time in 1716 , when the Dynasty in the first piece of porcelain , to present in 2016 , the technique on to its 300th anniversary . in order to memorialize this special moment in time , we plan to create a limited edition of 300 , with 100 overseas , in order to give those interested in art , porcelain and a chance to own a piece . These represent eternal sincerity and can be handed down from generation to generation . Sun is leading a team of twenty in the . From choosing the clay and the form , to firing the white clay , painting , firing again and color , each cup around twenty days to complete . As the of and forming the is quite complex , only three can be in the kiln at once , making the yield quite small , but the are astounding , proven through the ingenuity of 13 used to revive the technique lost for two . These can stand the test of time . Art is boundless . Passion , creativity , commitment , and the persistent pursuit of true art are trait of all human .

US,1.0,8450000,361.0,False,False,0,international,"This project is about a dream . One that over fifteen ago , and it is still ongoing . Life taken us on many in those fifteen , and in all honesty , getting this project off the ground was a long shot all along . No self respecting source would consider this . But with the of social we see a great opportunity to find out if what we have can if fact be made real . Up until now we have almost $ 1 . 5 million in the initial , exploratory phase of this project . Our initial desk - top plasma device produced some very early but encouraging . We are now looking to expand this work to its next phase . Our goal , in short , is to re - imagine the way we access space with this : Prototype inside and out We are seeking to create new technology , one that is sure to be the subject of much controversy . A new direction that is not based on our currently accepted and widely used space delivery we call rocketry . We are seeking to take a quantum leap forward , a giant leap for mankind if you will , by daring to think way outside the proverbial box . Our goal in nothing less than to develop a space access system based on the control of a universally available reactant - gravity . Upper faceplate covering science bay Gravity control would mean access to space on an unprecedented scale at a tiny fraction of today ' s cost . With gravity control the stuff of science fiction would become reality . If this technology is possible , development will take time . Upon success a whole new paradigm would open in our space faring endeavor . We would truly open a new frontier , one that many , and adventure . With the control of gravity we could access space on a scale comparable to air travel today . could depart hourly , about whole new like space mining , space tourism , and planetary exploration . "" This can ' t be done "" is what we usually hear . We are of the mind set that anything is possible when people put their mind to it . Twenty ago who would have that Apple would revolutionize the world with the and , Or that we would have so thin they can be bent . Or that private enterprise would have more available to access space than itself does . Can gravity be for flight ? No one . But we sure want to find out . The potential are immense . Some people ask "" Why ?"" ask "" Why not ?"". We belong in the latter group . So we are "" Why not ?"" Why not work on this , there is nothing to lose , and much to gain . In the initial phase of the project we are looking to demonstrate , under laboratory , that gravity can be with ( other than an apple falling on our ), , artificially . Once we have successfully establish this , the next step will be to build a technology demonstrator prototype , as here . Please keep in mind that all displayed are for illustration only and are only engineering . The shape of the craft is a direct result of technological needs , namely spin - symmetric . Any resemblance to real or phenomena is just a coincidence . This is a cross section of our craft . In the center of it is the propulsion system , a toroid shaped plasma chamber , the engine of change . A plasma based device capable of generating a field that can interact with gravity . We won ' t post lengthy and elaborate theoretical text on how this system may function . If we can build a working prototype the science of it will be in endless and , both in support and in contradiction . For this project we are interested in the dream , not the science . The dream of "" What if ?"" this can in fact be built . The possibility that our vision can be and in the not to distant future people can be visiting space on a daily basis . Lots of people . For a lot of time . Our flight demonstrator craft is composed of three : - the upper bay - the main body - and the lower bay . The upper bay will house mission specific scientific . There are 4 functional , each capable of holding one specific instrument cluster . These can range from equipment to collect data on initial , to better understand flight dynamics , to and interstellar matter collection for later . It is really up to our imagination to come up with an infinite combination of to carry . These are a few of such . Telescope and Spectrometer bay with energy storage ring Three scientific from upper bay The main body the propulsion system , power generation and storage system . flight control hardware , system , and the landing , among other support . Upper faceplate All electrical , main propulsion , are powered by the plasma based power generation unit . Power generation The lower bay is designed to house an autonomous rover for unmanned exploration . But this lower bay can also be for scientific cargo , same as the upper bay . Power storage We can also envision it carrying cargo to be deliver to the space station or anywhere on Earth , when timely delivery is of the essence . Again , the potential of this craft are unlimited . In fact we would welcome posted in the section . Landing leg This project is a "" What if "" scenario study therefore the social engineering available to us should be . We have also have some preliminary of our autonomous folding rover : Rover We can ' t stress it enough , that this project is , at best , speculative . We do believe the only way it can cross the first hurdle , disbelief , is if it is . Implementation money . The sheer benefit of the technology for investigation , but in reality , it is near impossible to get it funded . Unless we as people at large , decide to dream a little and crowd fund it .

The reason is because consciousness are happening to more and more western people who have little or no understanding of what is happening to them , nor do they have the ability to recognize it in . There is one consciousness in all of us and in mankind as a collective whole . It ' s nature is to evolve . As the understanding of its manifestation becomes more and more prevalent in western culture , the relevance of the higher of the east becomes paramount . Sooner or later in this lifetime or another , in your life will force you as an individual expression of consciousness , to evolve into the non linear subjective state of conscious awareness . The will be different but there is only one truth , one consciousness , and it ’ s through you right now . It not if you are , , , , or practice no formal religion or spirituality at all . You are part of It … You won ’ t leave here by death but by transcendence . I am an educated westerner , holding several professional , numerous patent . I have been a business owner , in capitalism and in the paradigm of intellect , logic , and reason . The following excerpt from my book is only one of many that forced the quest for understanding the truth of who and what we are . There is no stone left unturned reality , sanity , truth , and purpose . I was driving home from my study group , and was trouble what was real and what was ; what I would call . If you have ever seen before , I would describe these as being something similar , only they would surround various , although some were not associated with any or form at all . I ’ t really aware of it at the time because all real , or at least to have form . I was pretty confident that I was on the right road and headed in the right direction but my sense of space and location to be in another dimension . I had been seeing these for about a year now , mostly in the morning while driving to work . They would usually fade away when I directly at them . Tonight , they were not fading away . I made a left turn onto what I thought was the turn to go home . I straight ahead and I saw a pair of in the immediate distance pointing directly into my . I had turned down the left side of a divided highway and was going head on into oncoming traffic . I immediately a u turn and was able to right myself onto the correct side of the road , but was unable to determine exactly where home was . I knew I was in the area but the ability to rely on my sense of location , logic and linear thought was an impossibility . Time , space , and location which are linear were not accessible to a nonlinear state of mind , that I to be in . I had been in this nonlinear subjective state of thought many times before but had always been able to get to where I to be . To use logical sequential thought while you are in a state outside of time and space is not possible . I wish I could explain how I got home but there simply is not the ability to describe it in language . The linear concept understandable would be that of on intuition . Even this is not an adequate description . It ’ s like there is an intuitive that place outside of logical sequential thinking . It to act outside of time , space , and location . It is truly outside of the ability of language to give adequate description . This intuition comes from a source beyond the thinking mind . Implosion The removal of form . I sit here in the one room that I rent , in a home that I don ' t own , with a coffee pot , a microwave , and a picture tube . It ' s not a fancy flat screen either .

Our three - story home in a fancy suburb of was the center home of the - de - sac . As I drove up the hill to the house , I to enter the driveway that had a steep slope down into the garage . I suddenly felt this ( lump ) thump , and the sound of an aluminum lawn chair crunching and an awful groan . More like an oh ?. ! Oh ! I that the car was on top of my wife and that the only way to get it off her was to back up , so I backed up . It was a beautiful Easter in and had decided to sun bath in the driveway , on one of those low beach . It was impossible to see her the way the driveway slopped into the garage . Her shoulder was in several , she had several broken , a broken tail bone , and a torn femoral artery . The good news was she did not have brain damage nor any paralysis . She was alive but barely . After surgery , she spent about a week on the surgical recovery floor and was then to . I ' m not sure exactly how long she was in the hospital , but after discharge , she was confined to a hospital bed at home in the living room . We had visiting who to her until the insurance company stopped paying . Upon being , had been home only a few when she was on her way back to the hospital via ambulance due to excruciating pain . The broken and torn artery were causing horrific , and the road rash was so extensive that the had to train me on wound care , so I could tend to her when my insurance ran out . As she was going through surgery that evening , I received a call from the insurance company . They informed me that the call would be . So , I was forced to relive the accident in slow motion and in graphic detail . This detail included what ’ s I had gone to , what isle I had in , what toilet seat did I purchase , the color , and how much I for it . I took the call in the hall of the hospital and once it ended I found myself on the floor . About two after the surgery , I was driving in to see and my mind was spinning like crazy with so much on my plate . The police me . The police her if she to press .

Somehow , I made it to the hospital . I was walking down the hall and one of the I had come to know saw me and me if I was . I said no . She literally took me by my arm and me to the emergency room . I was in ER but I ' m not exactly sure what they gave me . The brain crash came back periodically for the next few but it was never as intense as the first one . I was totally powerless over when it would come and how long it would last . The only way I can describe it is that it felt like all the in my mind fired all at once and fried my brain .
