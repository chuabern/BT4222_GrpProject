(Also php7 is one of the fastest nowadays, so for scalability depending on how you structure your db and frontend, it may be worth sticking with it.)\\nKevin WebsterCreator\\nalmost 4 years ago\\n@Jon, the website is currently under development - although I\\'m not sure why its coming up with a 500 error as it should be showing an \"under construction\" page.\\nI made the decision to outsource the website to an external developer however, this hasn\\'t gone at all to plan and the result wasn\\'t what I\\'d requested so I\\'ll be re-developing the website myself.\\nThe old website wasn\\'t scalable and was something I\\'d hand-coded in php/html5. I\\'d hoped to have everything moved over to a WordPress site but like I say, this couldn\\'t have been any more of a bad idea.\\nPlease keep checking back at getblaze.co.uk, I aim to have something up within a couple of weeks - new forum (the old one had big issues), new shop (better implementation), a portal for developers (with actual, real content) and more hardware and software information.\\nOver the past few months, I\\'ve been working on programming Blaze through Arduino IDE and am currently working on supporting the standard Arduino libraries. I can now 100% confirm that it is possible to program Blaze via the Arduino IDE. Standard functions such as digitalWrite/digitalRead/analogRead are supported so far as well as some primitive graphical functions (including a demo showing 300+fps redrawing). I know this feature was requested a number of times during the Kickstarter campaign and hopefully now it will open up Blaze to a wider user-base as I appreciate that the KDS examples on the GitHub site are for the more advanced user and not at all hacker-friendly.\\nAs I\\'m a mostly-Windows developer, I\\'ll be releasing to GitHub the tools necessary for Blaze to work within Arduino IDE. If anyone would take these across to Linux/OSX, I\\'d be extremely grateful.\\nJon Strzalka\\nalmost 4 years ago\\nWhat happened to getblaze.co.uk?\\nMark Butcher\\nabout 4 years ago\\nBLAZE in action:\\nhttps://youtu.be/n-GABeILGV8\\nMark ;-)\\nKevin WebsterCreator\\nabout 4 years ago\\nSorry for the lack of responses to comments of late.\\n@kr4kon Is your Blaze board fried? Drop me a private message and I can arrange a repair if you wish? The chip close to the micro USB connector is a TVS diode for transient suppression on the USB signals. As Mark mentioned, the +3V3 is output only and should only be used to provide power to other devices - no power source should be connected to these pins.\\n@Mark, thanks again for your fantastic uTasker support and examples. Also, you are right, I think a flow diagram showing power and other such connectivity would be a good idea and help backers understand the ins and outs of the Blaze boards.\\n@Chris, please do let me know when/if something turns up.\\n@Eric, you should have received your replacement boards by know. Please come back to me if you have not.\\n@Anthony, I will be uploading the updater source to the GitHub site this evening.

Log in\\nMultec GmbHCreator\\nover 4 years ago\\n@Conquer119: We perform most of our work using Simplify3D as the slicer, however we have tested and used Slic3r as well. An advantage of Simplify3D is that it has a parameter we can set for the next X/Y coordinates, so that all of the hotends of the Multex4Move are covered when in motion and NOT printing (Called “free travel” in Simplify3D). Using the Multex2Move or the Multex4Move in conjunction with the free printing action, you can avoid stringing between printed areas. This means that with the Multex4Move you can avoid stringing problems in single material prints as well as prints using multiple materials.\\nOne of the tasks we are currently working on is to add this functionality directly into the firmware. This will allow other slicers capable of handling multiple materials to take advantage of this functionality.\\nAs to your question about the printer, we are offering our award-winning 3D printer Multirap M420 in this campaign as a reward: the Multriap M420 with 4Move as a construction kit. The Multirap has been distributed at Multec for 3 years and is a precise, stable and long-lasting 3D printer with print range up to 40cm: 210mmx400mmx220mm printing area.\\nFrage und Antwort in deutscher Übersetzung:\\nConquer119: Gibt es Software, die den 4Move unterstützt?\\nWenn es Software dazu gibt, ist das auch Freeware?\\nWarum liefert Ihr nicht auch einen Drucker über die Kickstarter-Kampagne?\\nAntwort von Multec:\\nWir arbeiten meist mit Simplify3D als Slicer, haben jedoch auch Slic3r schon eingesetzt. Ein Vorteil von Simplify3D ist, dass es eine Variable bietet für die nächste Position in X/Y-Koordinaten. Damit können für freies Verfahren ohne zu drucken alle Düsen abgedeckt werden können (in Simplify3D wird das mit „free travel“ bezeichnet).\\nBeim Einsatz des 2Move und des 4Move kann so auch das mit Strining bezeichnete Problem des Fadenziehens zwischen den Druckbereichen komplett verhindert werden. Das geht sowohl beim Multi-Material-Druck als beim Single-Druck.\\nEin Thema, das wir derzeit weiter entwickeln ist die Integration dieser Funktion in die Firmware. Das wird dann erlauben, auch bei anderen Slicern diese tolle Funktion einzusetzen.\\nBezüglich der Frage nach dem Drucker, wir bieten unseren bewährten und hervorragenden 3D-Drucker Multirap M420 mit Multex4Move als Bausatz in dieser Kampagne ebenfalls als Belohnung an. Der Multirap M420 wird schon seit 3 Jahren vertrieben, ein langlebiger, stabiler und präziser 3D-Drucker mit einer Druckfläche von bis zu 40cm:\\nDruckfläche 210mmx400mmx220mm. Wir werden in der Kampagne noch deutlich die technischen Daten des Gesamtdruckers beschreiben, vielen Dank für den Hinweis!\\nAndy TSuperbacker\\nover 4 years ago\\n@Conquer119 The printers are, and have been, available with the 4Move in this campaign - Multirap M420.

Bietet Ihr die Komponenten zu diesem Umbau an für den Differenzbetrag der beiden early-bird und regulären Geräte an? oder auch zu einem 3Move\\nMultec: Ja, wir können die Teile liefern um einen 2Move zu einem 3Move oder 4Move umzubauen. Da aber manche Teile komplett getauscht werden müssen, arbeiten wir noch an der Preisermittlung. Aber es sollte nicht viel mehr betragen als die Differenz.\\nAndyT: Der Metallhalter zwischen dem Motor und dem Hotend-Kopf sieht schwach aus, ist das wirklich die Struktur oder ist es tatsächlich eine geschlossene Box?\\nMultec: Der Halter ist aus 4mm Alumiumprofil, er ist stark und erprobt. Wir möchten hier nicht mehr Gewicht als notwendig einbauen. Die zusätzliche Abdeckung ist ein Druckteil, das leicht abgenommen werden kann für gute Zugänglichkeit.\\nAndyT: Wie lange dauert es bis die Abdeckscheibe voll von Kunststofftropfen ist, bis sie gereinigt werden muss? Zeigt bitte ein unbearbeitetes Zeitraffervideo von einem großen, mehrfach-farbigem Druckteil mit wasserlöslichem Support und zeigt danach, wieviel Kunststoff sich auf der Scheibe aufbaut.\\nMultec: Die Düsen werden beim Multex4Move verschlossen, so dass auf der Scheibe so gut wie kein Kunststoff verbleibt, da kann nichts tropfen. Im Moment testen wir drei zusätzliche Reinigungsmethoden für sehr lange Drucke - aber da ist fast nichts zu reinigen. Wir haben viel gedruckt, sowohl lange als auch kurze Drucke - ohne dazwischen zu reinigen.\\nWir werden natürlich so bald wie möglich und laufend weitere Videos zu den Geräten zeigen.\\nAndyT: Wieviel wiegt der 4Move und der 2Move, insgesamt, mit dem Drehmotor?\\nMultec: Der 2Move wiegt etwa 1,17kg, der 4Move 1,27kg inklusive Drehmotor.\\nMultec GmbHCreator\\nover 4 years ago\\n@Andy T: I have the answers to some of your questions below. Others we are working on.\\n1) We can provide the parts for converting the 2Move into a 3Move and/or 4Move, these kits we will provide as soon as possible. But as some parts have to be exchanged completely, we are still working on defining the price. It should not be much more than the difference however.\\n2) That´s a 4mm Aluminum bracket holder, it´s strong and approved. We prefer to not adding any more weight to this holder than necessary. The covering box is a printed part, and it can be easily removed for accessibility.\\n3) As the nozzle are actually closed off by the disk there is nearly no ooze on the disk itself. At the moment we are testing three different additional cleaning devices for very long prints – but there is not a lot to clean. We have done a lot of prints, both shorter ones and longer ones, all without cleaning the disk in between.\\n4) Of course, we will show some videos concerning your question as soon as possible.\\n5) Regarding the mass, we will check this in a few hours and get back to you.\\nAndy TSuperbacker\\nover 4 years ago\\n@Creators: Can the Multex2Move be easily converted later to a Multex4Move? Are you willing to provide the components to do so for the difference in the pledge levels between the two (early bird/early bird, regular/regular, etc)? Or additional half way in cost for a '3Move?\\nThe sheet metal bracket between the motor and the hot end carousel looks really flimsy. Is that really the structure or is it actually a closed box?\\nHow long before the wiper disk gets full of scraped-off ooze to the point where it needs to be cleaned out?\\nPlease show an unedited time-lapse of a large model, multicolor build, with soluble supports and at the end of the build, show the scrapeoff buildup.\\nHow much mass is in the '2Move and the '4Move, respectively, including the carousel motor?\\nthanks\",\n",

A question I\\'ve been meaning to ask (and will find out for myself soon anyway I guess!) is how many pages did the physical book end up at? I\\'d imagine around 120 or so?\\nAndrew DickinsonSuperbacker\\nover 2 years ago\\nIt\\'s physical book day! I bet you\\'re waiting by your door for the boxes to arrive, Sandeep (if they haven\\'t already). :-D\\nAndrew DickinsonSuperbacker\\nover 2 years ago\\nJust to add briefly to my Dreamcast rantings, and to show that my writing improved somewhat from when I was 16, here is an article I wrote about the Dreamcast back in 2012.\\nhttps://littlefishmag.wordpress.com/in-depth/more-than-a-dream/\\nAndrew DickinsonSuperbacker\\nover 2 years ago\\nNot had chance to read through it fully yet, but my flip through the digital copy made me smile so much! Love the layout, the design, the different sections... So much detail! From what I read, everything is well written too. I love the library and time line at the back, and I am already super excited to see what Year Two will bring!\\nIt got me thinking about other \\'failed\\' consoles, and how this format you\\'ve created could be great for them, especially the Sega Dreamcast. There is already a project that aims to be a very high-end look at the Dreamcast in book form, with lots of development images etc (which I can\\'t wait to read), but a more unofficial story about the Dreamcast year-by-year could be super interesting I think. It\\'d be an opportunity to maybe interview lower key players too, who get overlooked in larger releases. Speaking to people who wrote for the Official Dreamcast Magazine for example, or people who helped develop some of the lesser known titles. Waaaaaay back in the day I wrote (very badly) for dreamcastsource.co.uk (which is still available to browse!), so I was around and active in the UK Dreamcast community for the three years it was on the market here. It is my favourite console of all time, and I\\'m thinking that maybe the time is right to explore the Dreamcast like you have explored the Vita, and I\\'d love to maybe chat with you about that, Sandeep!\\nAnyway, back on topic... Love the book! Cannot wait to sit down and read it properly, cover to cover! You\\'ve done a fantastic job!\\nMohammed AlkhamisSuperbacker\\nover 2 years ago\\nHello Sandeep,\\nI need to change my delivery address.

When the NES classic edition came out, I was really disappointed with the supply shortages. This project (I got the kit) took a day for me to make, and multiple evenings for me to \"procure\" the Roms. I am so pleased with what I now have. It has come with me on 3 business trips, and one camping trip. I also have it setup in my home for whenever the urge arrives. Many thanks for the awesome project.\\nMike MeadSuperbacker\\nalmost 4 years ago\\nLike Pernicious Ducks said, there are tools to \"enhance\" the image so it looks good on our HDTVs. Here is a good article to get you started: https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Shaders-and-Smoothing. I noticed, especially on Genesis games, that HD makes the image look bad.\\nPerniciousDucksSuperbacker\\nalmost 4 years ago\\n@Mark what do you mean by enhanced graphics? Most of the ROM community focuses on trying to make them as retro authentic as possible. I\\'m using retropie and a shader to add screen lines and screen curve at the edges to make it feel like I\\'m playing on an old CRT.

I am currently pledged at the lifetime membership tier (which is over $430CDN for me) but I have one concern before I lock that in.\\nAre you able to reveal any more about what some of your future titles or publishing partners are going to be? I ask because a lot of the logos shown on the campaign page are the same batch of Data East and Technos games that they will license to anyone willing to pay and that are in a number of recent retro collections (most of the games in that logo graphic can be found in both Johnny Turbo\\'s Arcade and on systems like the Super Retro-Cade.) Titles like GODS also have remasters out in other places now too.\\nI absolutely love what you\\'re putting together here but we really need to see more than a lot of the predictable titles that are appearing everywhere else. Do you have more extensive partnerships with other publishers lined up so that we can expect more games that might be different than what you commonly see?\\nThanks very much!\\nShowing 3 of 4 replies\\nLoad previous replies\\nGerry Corcoran\\nalmost 2 years ago\\nHeya Jo!\\nI appreciate that contracts and non-disclosure are what they are. I work in Managed IT and oh yeah, we got a lot of those. :)\\nThat you already have licenses for 1,500 more games beyond the initial launch definitely puts Anstream miles ahead of just about anything else so that gives me a lot of confidence. I was planning to pledge either way, it was just a question of whether I wanted to go full lifetime or not. Looking at the budget this month, I think I\\'ll probably be keeping it there. :)\\nAlso, unrelated but I\\'m the Developer Relations Envoy for theSHED Community, a large and growing gaming community with a huge streamer contingent and a lot of retro players to boot. We\\'re forming what are called Community Partnerships with cool game makers and I\\'ve been trying to chat with you folks about that. I\\'ve sent a couple of e-mails through your contact form and hadn\\'t heard back but I know you\\'ve all been crazy busy with the campaign.\\nIf you\\'re interested in hearing about this idea (I\\'ve got some informational materials and it\\'s also not something we\\'re asking money for), feel free to send me an e-mail from the contact form at https://pxa.ca.\\nGood luck!\\nJoCollaborator\\nalmost 2 years ago\\nThanks Gerry, and thanks for the support!\\nI believe we have some details on SHED already that we were sent a week or so ago but with the hype of Play Expo and the kickstarter campaign I don\\'t think we\\'ve had chance to move thee forward. However, if you would like to send over any details fire them over to Jo.Clifford@antstream.com and I\\'ll take a look :) I know we would love to work with content creators either during early access or the beta period so the more the merrier.

When should we expect access codes?\\nJoCollaborator\\nalmost 2 years ago\\nFor early access it will likely be 2-3 weeks after the kickstarter has ended, this is to make sure that everything is done behind the scenes on kickstarters end at the end of the campaign, as there\\'s a bit of tidying up and admin to do as I\\'m sure you\\'ll understand :) Once this is out of the way though we\\'ll start rolling out those early access codes!\\nJohn WeldySuperbacker\\nalmost 2 years ago\\nAwesome!

I have a idea for a background character in the goblin world, but I also think it'd be cool to have the image file that's mentioned in the $100 pledge level. Should I pledge at the $100/125 tier? Are there goblins in the pre-demo-fight world?\\nGabe HicksCreator\\nover 1 year ago\\nTotally fair question and yes! That character could be a goblin if you'd like! The portal is considered an alternate plane so there could easily be doppelgangers ;) If you wanted to get the character sprite AND the bg it'd be pledging the $100 and then just then clicking manage pledge and upping it to $125\\nJay Carey\\nover 1 year ago\\nAwesome, thank you so much! I'm really excited about this game!\\nSamantha\\nover 1 year ago\\nRelated to Charlotte's question about the add-on goblin OC for the $100 tier, do we just alter our original pledge to $125 to get that?\\nGabe HicksCreator\\nover 1 year ago\\nFor the background character design yes!\\nMatthew BeckhamSuperbacker\\nover 1 year ago\\nThis is an interesting idea. I'm quite the fan of visual novels and this one looks different from the norm. You know, I never knew I wanted to date some goblins, but there you go. Also, I am a sucker for high fantasy setting in general.\\nWhat especially interests me is the attempt to add elements of actual role play into this. This certainly makes this stick out (as well as your goblins, of course). I do hope all goes well for you and I also hope to see this project go places.\\nBest of luck!\\nGabe HicksCreator\\nover 1 year ago\\nAppreciate it Matthew, thank you! We're ready to take this for the long term and really make something fun yet different!\\nCharlotte\\nover 1 year ago\\nThe $25 add-on to goblin one's oc; is that an After the Kickstarter Closes thing, or should I bump the pledge itself up to $125 now?\\nGabe HicksCreator\\nover 1 year ago\\ntotally fair question~!

I remember one of the survey questions you sent us being about other addons we\\'re interested in - out of all the ones I mentioned my vote would go towards this one. I\\'d even pay for it if there was another campaign. There are some comments in the reviews section on the addons website expressing how essential it is, and in bugzilla bug 92146 which has been a feature request for 20 years, so I wonder if the demand is there? For me I\\'m glad to have kept Send Later going but unfortunately I won\\'t be updating to TB 78 without AttachmentExtractor unless I\\'m forced to. (The addon author said it was too much work to update, I\\'m just assuming it\\'s technically possible though?)\\nTom\\n3 months ago\\nBTW I realise you have 8(?) other plugins to update first! So sorry if I\\'m jumping the gun by putting the question out there.\\nJonathan KamensCreator\\n3 months ago\\nYeah, I\\'m not going to be thinking about other add-ons until I manage to get the ones from the campaign finished. :-/\\nHans Bruijnen\\n4 months ago\\nHallo Jonathan,\\nI am using TB 78.5.0 on several machines with WIN 10 Pro.\\nSend later does not work for me.

Also, just to confirm, you\\'re on TB78, correct?\\nRyan C Jenkins\\n5 months ago\\nHonestly I didn\\'t know there was a built-in \"Send Later\" in TB.
