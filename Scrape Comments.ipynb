I’ve backed all your stuff before and have never been disappointed with your work but the way you’ve approached this Kickstarter is honesty disheartening.\\nMiles GrebCreator\\n5 months ago\\nDo not worry that is not what is happening - Puc the Artist is going to be printed no matter what. I am not sure if you read the digital copy I released, but it's a huge chunk of the story, there is a ton of work done on this book. After we made the call to make it more then 66 pages, it was going to take a bit more time to get done. This year has been crazy for me, and I am sure many, and when it getting around time to print the book it became clearly to me it was going to save me a ton of money and hassle to print it at the same time as ATGR. That does not mean it only gets printed if ATGR does well. I will still print it if it should fail. It's just with not being able to work, and there not being comic cons I have very little income this year. Saving around $3000 printing them together is something I just have to do if I can. I understand it makes the wait longer, and that sucks. I want the book out too, Garret and I are dying to share this story. But please don't worry, you will get your book and you will be getting way more pages then you paid for I promise\\nSebastian LevensonSuperbacker\\n5 months ago\\nOkay Miles, I appreciate you taking the time to send me all this.

The packaging was so beautiful that I’ve repurposed it to hold some postcard sized watercolour paper I cut. It’s the perfect size for my handbag and it looks and feels wonderful to use! I am currently attempting to make a couple of watercolour journals from Arches and Fabriano Artistico to fit in my Sketch Wallet so I can use it to paint in on the go. I’m so glad I opted for the Tahoe Blue colour. It makes me happy every time I get it out to sketch. Well done!\\nRalph ThomasCreator\\n19 days ago\\nThanks Nicole! That made my day. You may be interested in my latest post. I found some amazing watercolor and multimedia paper that fits the original size 2.0 wallets. I believe you got that size so it would work for your wallet. But, I always love to see artists make custom books for their wallet :-)\\nChris McGrory\\nabout 1 month ago\\nHi Ralph, received the missing pencils this morning, many thanks for sorting and thanks again for the excellent sketch wallet!\\nSeraph HowesSuperbacker\\nabout 2 months ago\\nHas the quality of the blank sketchbooks changed? Besides the front not being embossed the paper seems thinner than the one I received as a single with the wallet.\\nOtherwise the wallet is beautiful and tons of space, I’ve already had a few friends see it and want one of their own. The toned paper sketchbooks are also really nice.\\nWill lined and gridded sketchbooks become available for the large size wallet at some point?\\nRalph ThomasCreator\\nabout 2 months ago\\nHello! The quality of the paper should be the same but if the covers are smooth laminated it means you received the previous version by mistake. All the original size covers should be an embossed synthetic material. We're happy to send you out the correct ones if you like. Thanks for the kind words and sharing out product with others. We're currently trying to figure out UK distribution so you can get our stuff faster and cheaper shipping. Lined books may be awhile before we are back in stock but the original size has lots of books that fit that size. Moleskine Cahiers are a good option.\\nAaron Zsoldos & Emely PulSuperbacker\\n2 months ago\\nArrived in Canada.
